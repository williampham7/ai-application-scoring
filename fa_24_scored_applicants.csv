Joining ABA would offer me invaluable hands-on experience in key areas such as financial advisory, business analysis, and client communications. The club’s diverse projects and case studies will provide me with the opportunity to work on real-world problems, applying theoretical knowledge in practical settings. My previous role as a market strategy and operations intern at ICBC honed my abilities in preference and profitability analysis, and strengthened my communication skills through regular client interactions and team collaborations. These experiences have given me a solid foundation in strategic thinking and data-driven decision-making, which I am eager to leverage and expand upon within ABA. My background in analyzing market trends and operational efficiencies will enable me to contribute effectively to ABA’s consulting projects, supporting both individual and team-based initiatives.

Through my involvement with ABA, I aim to deepen my expertise in market research and real case analysis. Participating in ABA’s projects and case studies will allow me to apply theoretical knowledge to practical scenarios, enhancing my analytical skills and problem-solving abilities.

This experience will be instrumental in preparing me for complex challenges in my future career, making me more adept at navigating the consulting and finance landscapes.","Success Through Collaboration

Everything highlighted in my resume underscores the critical role of collaboration in achieving success. For example, the Job Readiness Program’s achievement of connecting with over 20 companies and 120 students in its inaugural year was a direct result of effective teamwork. To facilitate this, I took the lead on establishing connections with companies, ensuring we secured a diverse range of partners who could offer valuable opportunities to students. Meanwhile, a colleague focused on engaging with students, working to understand their needs and preferences to tailor our outreach effectively. We held bi-weekly progress meetings to align our strategies, address any challenges, and adjust our approach as needed, ensuring both sides of the program were seamlessly integrated.

Recognizing the need for further enhancement, we expanded our team by recruiting two additional members with expertise in technology. These new team members were instrumental in developing sophisticated matching algorithms and preference orderings, which significantly improved the accuracy and efficiency of our student-company pairings. By leveraging their technical skills, we were able to streamline the process and provide more personalized recommendations, which contributed to the program’s overall success.

In this collaborative environment, each team member’s specialized role and coordinated efforts led to a synergy that far exceeded the sum of individual contributions. The collective impact of our combined expertise and collaborative approach demonstrated that effective teamwork can drive substantial progress and achieve ambitious goals.",Business Development,Strategy,Marketing,https://drive.google.com/open?id=1okCVS0XUxJHjUQ3QP4Dlseg6o_XsNwZu,"Instagram, Website, Handbill/Flyer, Friend",Asian (including Indian subcontinent and Philippines origin),,15,15.0

Throughout my academic journey, from studying in Kenya to pursuing my degree at UC Berkeley, I have developed a strong interest in understanding how organizations operate and how strategic decisions are made. ABA offers a platform to further explore these interests in a collaborative and supportive environment.

What excites me most about ABA is the chance to work alongside like-minded peers who are passionate about business and leadership. I’m eager to contribute my unique perspectives, shaped by my global experiences and my background in data analysis and environmental science. At the same time, I hope to learn from the diverse talents and insights of my teammates, gaining a deeper understanding of different industries and honing my skills in teamwork and problem-solving.

Through my experience with ABA, I aim to strengthen my leadership abilities, build a strong professional network, and gain practical experience that will be invaluable in my future career. I see ABA as an opportunity to grow both personally and professionally, preparing me to tackle complex challenges and make a meaningful impact in the business world.","The core value of **""Success Through Collaboration"" (#INIT2GETHER)** best describes me. My experience as Head of School during the challenging period of the COVID-19 pandemic truly embodies this principle. Leading a student body of over 850 peers and staff at Rugby School, I quickly learned that collaboration was essential to creating a supportive and resilient community during unprecedented times.

Faced with the challenges of remote learning and social isolation, I spearheaded initiatives to ensure that students remained connected and supported. This included organizing virtual events, creating online platforms for peer interaction, and facilitating open forums where students could voice their concerns. Collaboration was at the heart of these efforts—I worked closely with fellow prefects, teachers, and administrators to ensure that we were meeting the diverse needs of our community. It wasn’t about any one person leading the charge; it was about everyone stepping up and contributing to a collective effort to keep our school community strong and united.

Additionally, during the Black Lives Matter movement, I played a key role in promoting cultural inclusion within the school. This involved collaborating with students and staff to create safe spaces for dialogue and education, ensuring that everyone had the opportunity to participate and be heard.

These experiences taught me that leadership is most effective when it’s shared, and success is best achieved when everyone works together toward a common goal. I’m excited to bring this collaborative mindset to ABA, where I believe we can achieve great things by supporting and learning from each other.",Business Development,Finance,Marketing,https://drive.google.com/open?id=1JK0nMTbZoyLfD3BmUsBx38L6kXeXBm0u,Calapalooza,White,,15,14.0

I believe they will properly prepare, develop, and provide me with the exposure I need for future internships and job opportunities. Currently, I have a strong interest in consulting, as I was able to briefly work with Bain Consulting this past summer through my internship with Pepsi Manila. This experience ignited my passion for consulting as I discovered a huge bottleneck within Pepsi’s production that led to decreases in profit. The feeling I perceived when my discovery led to an actual impact on the client was extremely heartwarming and something that I wish to recreate in the future. Although I am open to exposure to other business areas, consulting as of now, is my primary passion.

Looking at ABA’s past alumni, many of them were able to secure top-tier internships in consulting, finance, engineering, etc. I hope that working alongside a driven team will enable me to develop skills such as process mapping, PowerPoint building, data analysis, and, ultimately, acting as a good teammate. Working with a team is an attribute that is needed in numerous aspects of life, so although it will help me prepare for work, it will also prepare me for life. ABA’s goals and values align with mine, so it seems like the optimal business organization for me.
","While I believe all the core values are important to me, the one that resonates the most is #BE. I am constantly eager and driven to learn and do more. I strongly agree with the value’s message that there is always something new to learn, even at the top. Being at the early stages of my career, I recognize I have a lot to learn, but I still hold myself to high standards because I know this will help me achieve my goals. Despite being shy and reserved, I push myself to step out of my comfort zone and demonstrate my ambition and passion for my field.

From my experiences, I've learned that reaching out to those in power to ask questions and learn more is a valuable and appreciated action. During my summer internship, I proactively reached out to the CEO of Pepsi Manila and two senior partners at Bain Consulting for coffee chats. I was fortunate to secure all these meetings, where I took the opportunity to seek advice and share my professional passions. They not only offered insights into developing specific skills but also provided life advice. They all appreciated that I reached out, recognizing the grit, ambition, and passion it took. Without these qualities, I wouldn’t have been able to build such connections. I believe that everyone, including myself, has something to learn from others, and I am eager to gain similar connections and knowledge within ABA.

With a track record spanning over 45 years, ABA has proven its ability to nurture talent and deliver impactful business strategies, which aligns perfectly with my career goals and previous experiences. My entrepreneurial journey, starting with iPegasus Limited at age 14, instilled in me a deep understanding of business operations, management, and innovation. This early experience was further explored by my roles at Y-Combinator start-up Team Note and Microsoft, where I engaged in full-stack development and project management, respectively. These roles sharpened my skills in data interpretation and strategic thinking, which are crucial for the type of high-level consulting Berkeley ABA is known for.

This supportive environment fosters both personal and professional growth, which is crucial for tackling complex business challenges. I am thrilled to meet people with similar, goal-oriented mindset and am eager to contribute my background in data science and strategic consulting to a team that values collaboration and excellence.

Growing up, my family raised me with a unique twist on “The Frog in the Well.” This version tells of not one, but many frogs trapped in the shadowy depths of a well. Among them, two frogs dared to escape and began their ascent. However, only one triumphed, reaching the sunlight, while the other faltered midway. The secret to success was not strength or agility but deafness – immune to the cacophony of doubt from below, they climbed, fueled by the silent rhythm of faith. 

This legacy has instilled in me a relentless drive to chase ambitious dreams, to find rhythm in the march of progress, and to empower others with the resolve that fuel me. Growing up, I knew that possibilities are endless if we simply dare to pursue them, and I find that exhilarating. I’ve strived to explore and execute what hasn’t been to unveil these possibilities so that others would feel comfortable trailing similar paths, yet I understand the best lessons could come from what might seem ordinary. Moreover, I learnt the importance to create a supportive space where doubts become positive affirmations.

The #BE principle echoes my admiration for this grandeur of life – the stunning landscapes, the deep oceans, and the countless people to meet. I braved the biting cold alongside the researchers at Novolazarevskaya Station on their cargo sleds. I shared biscuits with innocent Ugandan children in Bwindi. I reveled in infectious laughter with Hong Kong's local refugees in Tamar Park. Together, we crafted chapters of shared stories, and I’m beyond excited for more.

As someone committed to studying economics and pursuing a career in business, I view ABA as a pivotal stepping stone toward achieving my aspirations. ABA presents an ideal environment to leverage and expand my passion for analytical problem-solving and project management—skills I’ve developed through my experience leading the Stanford Red Barn interscholastic showjumping equestrian team. In this role, I was responsible for managing team operations, planning training schedules, and organizing competitions. These tasks demanded effective resource management and innovative problem-solving in a dynamic setting, experiences that have equipped me to tackle real-world business challenges.
ABA's focuses aligns seamlessly with my objective of understanding and resolving complex business problems.

Establishing connections with seasoned consultants and business leaders will give me insights into industry trends and guide my career trajectory. The collaborative and leadership skills I cultivate through ABA will be essential for my success in the business field. Overall, ABA represents an ideal fit for my college plans, offering both practical experience and valuable connections as I work toward my career goals.","I deeply connect to the ""learn and give back"" value of ABA, driven by a personal experience that shaped my mission. Witnessing my older brother's financial difficulties, after graduating in mass amounts of student loan debt, I became acutely aware of the profound impact financial literacy can have on individuals' lives, inspiring me to embark on a mission to promote financial literacy as a social impact initiative with the Miss America Organization. My mission has been to empower individuals with the financial knowledge and skills they need to achieve financial responsibility and freedom. I designed and created a website that offers personal finance education and I partnered with financial volunteers who provide guidance and mentorship on financial issues. To reach a wider audience, I established a personal finance club at my high school and conducted financial literacy workshops at +30 local schools and community centers, providing students of all grades with the basics of financial planning, budgeting, saving, and spending.
The financial challenges I witnessed haven’t only opened my eyes to the widespread lack of personal finance education but also shaped my personal journey. Beyond learning about finance, I’ve also gained valuable experience in website development, volunteer recruitment, content creation, and public speaking. My brother's story ignited my passion for financial education and directly addressing a significant need within my community, reflecting the core value of learning and giving back that drives my commitment to making a difference.

At ABA, I will get to know and become friends with members specialized in different fields, and also improve my skills in the process of learning and recruiting. Having previously worked in private equities and investment banks, I honed my industry knowledge and business acumen when conducting industry research about different fields in healthcare and improved my communication skills when doing industry research and getting in touch with company leaders. These experiences not only enhanced my skills, but also motivated me to further pursue my interest in finance and that leads me to ABA. At ABA, I’m confident will learn how to think like a great analyst and investor, and get a lot of senior exposure. I am confident that my experiences make me a great fit to become a member of CBA. I really look forward to joining and contributing to CBA community this fall.","I always think of myself a expert in balancing being professional and having fun. During my first year at Berkeley, to further move toward my goals in the field of finance, I’ve pursued a number of internships to apply my academic knowledge and to gain experience. I worked as a Private Equity Analyst Intern with Emerson Capital Partners where I conducted industry research in healthcare, specifically oncology, and assessed the industry landscape, headwinds, tailwinds, and thematic trends to identify potentially attractive targets. Furthermore, I helped diligence the initial lists of target companies by creating basic financial profiles and securing executive contact information to help my founder with outreach. Also, during the summer, I completed the internship program at another PE firm, Magnolia Hill Partners, where I built comprehensive lists of historical buyouts and investments of sports franchises globally on various sports insudtries especially soccer. These experiences not only honed my industry knowledge and business acumen, but also motivated me to further pursue my interest in finance. Besides the internship experiences, I believe having fun is as important as the being professional.

Based on the research I have done on clubs at Berkeley, ABA has created true community connections and a family. Most of the other clubs that I looked into had little to no opportunities to gather lifelong friendships and genuine connections. The house system, club retreats, social events, and especially the Big-Lil program creates an inclusive community that goes beyond a traditional professional environment. Personal and professional development go hand in hand in the real word. What distinguished ABA for me is its commitment to core values while also focusing on professional growth. It is crucial to me to join a community that puts a strong emphasis on having core values instead of only focusing on its ranking in respect to other clubs. I believe that success in business should be rooted in ethical values and ABA's core values reflect that. ABA's industry-focused projects appeal to me as they align with my aspirations to become an entrepreneur. The projects will provide me hands-on experiences and expose me to the many challenges in owning a company. Additionally, the many workshops ABA offers its members will aid me in becoming better prepared for my future professional career in business and contribute to my overall growth. ABA aligns perfectly with my goals and aspirations. Joining ABA is not just about gaining professional skills but rather becoming a part of a community that values both personal connections and professional growth. I truly believe that ABA will set me up for success professionally and give me lifetime memories that I will cherish. ","The ABA core value that mostly aligns with me is ""learn and give back"". In high school I researched the poverty levels in my area, Arcadia, and how this affected the learning abilities of the students. I uncovered that the students facing socio-economic hardships suffered from multiple challenges such as inadequate nutrition leading to difficulties concentrating. I solely spearheaded a new lunch program dedicated to eliminate students' potential lunch debt and any financial burden on students by providing $9.50 per day for lunch/meal costs. The program directly benefited over 50 students enrolled in the San Miguel Scholarship, a scholarship for students with a family income below the poverty line. I successfully implemented this program through collaborative efforts by working one-on-one with principal, vice-principal, and teachers. The San Miguel scholars now have an equitable access to daily nutritious lunches and meals at school. Not only did I gain the knowledge of the poverty levels in my area and how it affects the students but I also gained new skills in communication. By working alongside my high school principal, vice-principal, and teachers I engaged in meaningful back and forth conversations to construct the San Miguel Lunch Fund. The lunch fund reinforced the core value ""learn and give back"" as I applied what I learned to address this national real-world issue in my high school. The lunch fund is only a small step to improve the impact of poverty on students affected.

Although in theory this sounded great, coming into college, I was uncertain about almost every aspect of the “college experience” and more so about myself. How do I find a community of like-minded people? How do I decide what I want to pursue? These ideas were constantly running through my head. To me, ABA is a place that allows me to explore these ideas of uncertainty while having the chance to find my own unique-ability. 

For one, ABA provides the opportunity to focus on projects that could provide experience in various industries. Whether it is working with high-level tech companies for finance or large retail stores for marketing, having the opportunity to communicate and visualize your ideas to top-industry professionals is an experience I cherish. Because ABA understands their clients are their top priority, they are better able to produce high quality work. From handpicking and training us based on our expertise to allowing us to grow in such an expansive environment, each one of us is able to truly explore our unique-ability.  

Furthermore, college is all about having the opportunity to meet new people and find a community of long-lasting relationships, and I feel ABA is the perfect avenue to explore that. From having the chance to talk to ABA members and how they value their peers in the club to having authentic and driven conversations, it is quite evident how genuine this community truly is. To me, ABA serves as more than just a club but a place for passion, curiosity, and unique-abilities.","Every morning, I wake up to the smell of a dish my mom has made. From a crispy hash brown to a grilled cheese sandwich, I was comforted by the thought of waking up to food on the table and a roof over my head. However, for many people, a home is a privilege rather than a basic amenity. 

As a legislative intern, I was fortunate to “learn and give back” by tackling the issue of homeless poverty within Fort Bend County. Though Fort Bend’s community is fairly wealthy, it is estimated that there are between 6,000 to 9,000 homeless individuals at any given year, with nearly half being children. 
        
Therefore, I collaborated with the Fort Bend Family Promise Center (FBFPC). Through this partnership, I conversed with 40+ homeless families in an effort to understand their experiences. More than the requirement for a shelter and meal, consistent support would be necessary for self-sufficiency. Thus, in meeting with the director of the organization, I was able to put together a set of policy initiatives, one of which included affordable housing and a financial plan that aimed to foster long-term independence. 

After coupling my ideas with existing data, I presented my proposal at the Student Conference at the Texas Capitol. Though my plan won’t see fruition overnight and will require collaboration with policy-makers, I influenced Representative Jacey Jetton to introduce monetary aid for sheltering facilities within FBFPC and custom legislation regarding homeless poverty.

As a first-generation college student who spent three years of elementary school in China and frequently moved between China and the U.S., I have firsthand experience navigating cultural and language barriers. These experiences fostered a deep understanding of the struggles that individuals face in unfamiliar environments, particularly those who do not speak the local language fluently or are adjusting to new cultural expectations.

Growing up, I became my parents’ primary translator, helping them with everything from daily conversations to complex official documents. While I was learning English and managing my own academic challenges, I also took on the role of guiding my family through the complexities of life in the U.S. This role not only taught me responsibility but also deepened my empathy, as I understood the anxiety and frustration my parents faced during these transitions. I learned to be patient and thoughtful, listening to their concerns and ensuring they felt supported.

These experiences have made me passionate about creating environments where people from all backgrounds feel heard, valued, and understood. I believe empathy is crucial in any organization, and I am eager to bring this value to ABA. By actively listening and engaging with others, I aim to foster a collaborative and inclusive atmosphere supporting individual and collective growth.",NPO,Business Development,Strategy,https://drive.google.com/open?id=1jnA7Qtfc_RZgwL9fW5-_1cn2cnCmdeWA,"Instagram, Friend",Asian (including Indian subcontinent and Philippines origin),:),15,14.0

Consulting captivates me due to the opportunity it provides to build personal connections with clients and play a crucial role in their growth and development. This ability to make a tangible impact through tailored solutions and collaborative relationships is what draws me to the field.

At Berkeley, I have been actively seeking ways to deepen my understanding and experience in consulting. Many clubs offer practical consulting opportunities, but ABA stands out to me for its exceptional sense of community. To me, a club should be more than just a platform for academic and professional advancement—it should be a supportive network and a second home. My interactions with ABA members at tabling events and info sessions have demonstrated the club’s genuine commitment to inclusivity and camaraderie. The warmth and openness of the ABA community have convinced me that this is a place where I can truly belong.

Through my involvement with ABA, I hope to achieve two main objectives. First, I am eager to forge new friendships and build a network of like-minded individuals who share my passion for consulting. Second, I look forward to gaining hands-on, professional experience that bridges the gap between theoretical knowledge and real-world application. Engaging in ABA’s projects and initiatives will allow me to apply my skills in practical settings, enhancing my consulting expertise and contributing meaningfully to both the club and its clients.","
My greatest personal strength lies in my ambitiousness and tenacity to seek improvements within the status quo.

During the summer before my sophomore year, I began volunteering at Community Services Agency (CSA), a local food bank. My responsibilities included sorting produce, loading food into trucks, and distributing meals to families. Seeing the gratitude of the families we served inspired me, but I knew that I could extend my impact to a broader community.

In spring 2023, I co-founded a nonprofit called Plentiful Provisions (PP). Together, we've mobilized peers nationwide, organizing hundreds of volunteer hours and delivering thousands of meals. Our mission is to build a robust network of youth volunteers to ensure that no family faces hunger.

Despite these efforts, I felt that addressing only the immediate needs of poverty was insufficient. I wanted to tackle the deeper economic issues at their root. When I learned about CSA’s Guaranteed Basic Income (GBI) study, I was eager to get involved. I secured an interview with Deputy City Manager Kimberly Thomas and was subsequently offered an internship with the Mountain View City Government’s Guaranteed Income Works National Tour. This role gave me valuable hands-on experience with GBI’s impact and allowed me to advocate for similar solutions by organizing local field hearings.

Through my education, I aim to understand the underlying causes of food insecurity and income inequality. Regardless of where my journey takes me, I remain committed to staying grounded in the community, always mindful of the human cost of inaction.",Business Development,Strategy,Marketing,https://drive.google.com/open?id=17jrKF65v1kT4pGcV1iF31GmVo0GUeBlf,"Website, Handbill/Flyer, Calapalooza",Asian (including Indian subcontinent and Philippines origin),,14,15.0

ABA has captivated my interest in that I will have hands-on experience, working closely with incredible companies and individuals that will help me develop these skills.  While I know that ABA is more than capable of providing this experience, the kind nature of the current members is what I am drawn to the most. Watching all the different members interact with each other during the first info session felt like watching an extended family in an organic and genuine way that I seldom see around campus. I thoroughly enjoyed conversing with every member I’d spoken to, driving my desire to be challenged, determined, and successful with people who I would love to work with. Becoming a part of ABA would give me the opportunity to utilize the skills I have to produce tangible results, a current example being the strategy team’s partnership with Marathon to develop a successful calendar for a rewards program that I currently use, being able to add real-life insight on a project that will benefit from real experiences when paired with analytical evaluation. The strategy team specifically interests me in that it involves a near-scientific approach to solving issues in a way that aligns with my academic work and processes in a science-based major. I welcome the challenge that ABA presents and would love to be a part of the club moving forward.","Soccer is one of the most fundamental aspects of my life that helped me develop countless skills and habits that benefit me on a daily basis. Playing for over a decade and learning under countless great coaches, I developed into a player who captained my school’s varsity team for two years, and earned league-wide recognition for the hard work that I had put in. I learned priceless skills and habits that were applicable outside of the field, and had always wanted to pass that knowledge to young children who’s shoes I was once in. So, following ABA’s value of learning and giving back, I organized and devoted hundreds of hours of my time to coach over eighty children in my community over the course of my last two years of high school. I was able to teach them fundamental habits in consistency, hard work, teamwork and dedication in my with them, all while being able to draw their attention through sports in the same way that I had learned to develop those habits. Where I gained invaluable experience from my coaches, I was able to provide the same to those who stood where I once had, asking only for the parents to provide shoes and water for their kids.

Throughout my experiences in consulting, business development, and entrepreneurship—such as my internship at IEC Partners and volunteering at Girls Crushing It—I’ve developed a passion for collaborating with diverse teams and creating real-world impact. ABA's track record of providing hands-on workshops and opportunities for personal growth perfectly aligns with my desire to strengthen my leadership and business acumen.

I hope to contribute to and learn from ABA’s driven, like-minded individuals by leveraging my background in both psychology and economics. I’m eager to grow my network within ABA and to learn from others who share my professional ambitions but may come from different disciplines and perspectives. Through collaboration, I’m confident I can develop new skills in problem-solving and strategic thinking while also contributing my own insights.

Ultimately, I hope to leave ABA not only with a stronger foundation in business but also lifelong connections and a deeper understanding of how to navigate the corporate world while staying true to my values.","The ABA value of “Learn and Give Back” (#GAIN&GIVE) resonates deeply with me, as it reflects my belief in the power of applying learned skills to create a positive impact and then sharing those lessons with others. My internship at IEC Consulting Partners allowed me to apply theoretical knowledge in economics and psychology to real-world scenarios, demonstrating the value of giving back through business solutions that foster social responsibility.

One project I worked on involved helping an early-stage company expand its market for gluten-free, health-conscious consumers. Our strategic recommendations, such as partnering with platforms like Thrive Market, addressed the growing demand for sustainable food options. By emphasizing social responsibility and market growth, I learned that successful strategies can also promote broader societal benefits.

In another project, we explored the potential of AI-based customer data solutions to streamline telecommunications operations. Our findings revealed that this not only increased efficiency but also enabled the company to support underserved regions by offering more accessible services. These experiences solidified my commitment to giving back, demonstrating that financial growth and social responsibility can go hand in hand.

I strive to apply my skills to promote inclusive growth, and I am eager to pass on these insights by mentoring and collaborating with others at ABA, ensuring that the knowledge I gain continues to fuel collective success.",Strategy,Business Development,NPO,https://drive.google.com/open?id=1fx28I10id7e1BZFZe5226OET-7B9Hu-f,Friend,Asian (including Indian subcontinent and Philippines origin),,14,14.0

I became a marketing Project Manager for the Davis Consulting Group, career mentor in the Finance and Investment Club, and co-founder of UC Davis chapter of Product Space. Reflecting on my time at UC Davis, the most impactful experience was with the Davis Consulting Group. It ignited my passion for problem-solving and driving meaningful value for clients through consulting. This role not only sharpened my professional skills but also connected me with a close-knit community of driven, humble individuals who have become some of my closest friends.

Despite thoroughly enjoying my time at UC Davis, I recognized my desire to further develop my technical, data-driven analytical skills and gain experience in high-stakes client relationships, particularly with larger corporations. This realization motivated my transfer to UC Berkeley, where I saw greater opportunities for professional and personal growth.

After attending an ABA Info Session and meeting its members, I am confident that joining ABA will allow me to leverage my expertise in finance, product management, and marketing consulting while gaining invaluable experience contributing to larger consulting projects under the mentorship of distinguished project managers and upperclassmen. Additionally, ABA’s supportive community resonates with me. I see a group of like-minded individuals who value both professional and personal connections, and I am eager to contribute to and grow within this community throughout my college experience.","ABA’s core value that best describes me is ""Just Serious Enough."" While I take professional development seriously and care deeply about my career success and the impact of my work, I’ve learned that my ability to succeed is tied not just to hard work, but also to taking time to rest, play, and enjoy life as a college student. For me, life is meant to be experienced fully, and during this unique time in college, joy, laughter, and spontaneity are essential.

In a professional student organization like ABA, excellence in client work is undoubtedly important. However, I believe the foundation for producing quality work starts with fostering a strong, positive club community—one that recognizes we’re all ultimately students learning and growing together. By embracing a ""Just Serious Enough"" mindset, I can focus when needed and deliver high-quality results, but also relax, joke around, and build meaningful relationships.

During my time as a project manager for the Davis Consulting Group, I embodied this value. Our team worked on a major implementation engagement with Teaspoon, which required delivering four comprehensive deliverables in just ten weeks. Despite the workload, I made time for team socials, hosting spontaneous hangouts at my apartment or out downtown to celebrate milestones or even take breaks between our work sessions. This approach not only improved morale but also strengthened our friendships and ultimately enhanced the quality of our work.

Additionally, ABA being the oldest business organization at UC Berkeley is an incredible achievement and I would love to be a part of the legacy that ABA continues to build upon.

Throughout my 4 high school years, I competed in VALORANT tournaments every weekend, representing different organizations and constantly striving to improve my skills. I gained invaluable experience through working with expert coaches and experiencing what it was like to play against the best of the best. In my senior year of high school, I decided to take a step back from competing and instead focused on giving back to my community. I launched my high school's first ever eSports program, where we hosted rosters in League of Legends, VALORANT, Super Smash Bros, and much more. Each of these rosters went on to compete in the California Interscholastic Federation and as team captain of the VALORANT team, I was able to lead our team to win a $7K tournament that featured over 70 high schools in Southern California. Additionally, we competed in different circuits and even qualified to compete nationally in Kansas City. Although these accolades showcased our skill, I was most proud when we were able to secure funding from the school district for a brand-new computer lab. Through this, I was able to leave behind a legacy as well as an inclusive environment for all students to learn about eSports.

What separates ABA from other clubs is their unique commitment toward consulting-projects that empower local, small businesses, start ups, and non profits. The fact that ABA seeks regular clients such as non-profits and startups exemplifies their commitment toward compassionate consulting, which distinctly sets them apart from other campus clubs. 

Over the past few years, I have focused my time on representing marginalized-voices in my community, and I aspire to continue this through ABA. 

For example, when I became captain of my robotics team in high school, one of the first things I did was change how members were assigned roles during practices and competitions, as some members hogged tasks and assignments for themselves. I offered manageable tasks, like building the framework, to beginners and, for experienced members, I delegated responsibilities tailored to their skills and experience. With everyone being included, our performance grew, and we won 3rd-Place in our division at Nationals.

My experiences compel me to ensure everyone I work with feels included and valued. I am drawn to ABA because I seek to expand this self-less vision that ABA prides itself on of giving back to the community through a shared team experience.","ABA’s core value of being humble, ambitious, and tenacious resonates with me due to my experience and work that I did in a non profit in the past few years.

When I discovered Encode Justice, a nonprofit that advocates for the ethical use of AI, I started my own chapter in California to raise public awareness. Through the organization, I learned AI can be dangerous as it can be used to spread misleading information, and I campaigned to promote ethical-uses of AI.

In the beginning, I called attention to this issue by interviewing individuals affected by biased surveillance technologies and sharing their stories online, but despite building an online audience of 6,000+ after months of work, I saw no actual decrease in use of these systems. Wanting to make a real difference, I sought more effective ways to limit AI.

I reached out to lawyers and software engineers to help me understand the ethical concerns and they suggested I address the problem through legislation. I led my chapter’s 40+ members in contacting legislators to engage in direct conversation about AI ethics. As a result of my new strategy, a bill that criminalizes AI-generated child-pornography is making its way through the California State Senate. This experience taught me that, even when my initial efforts aren’t effective, being persistent and adaptable can lead to success.

My willingness to persist and pivot when things don’t work enabled me to make real change through Encode Justice. With these experiences, I feel confident that I can hold onto ABA’s value of being humble and tenacious as I persevere through challenges I may face at ABA.",NPO,Business Development,Strategy,https://drive.google.com/open?id=1OuE8EziX2il7N5ERyH64MU4DImfeippL,"Instagram, Friend","Asian (including Indian subcontinent and Philippines origin), Middle Eastern, Central Asian",Mixed with Pakistani & Afghani parents,14,14.0

I realized that this was something that I’ve inherently been interested in and I’m hoping to pursue that interest and hopefully make it a career. I really love the idea of going through a design/ideation process to solve a problem or make something better. I’d love to go through that process and learn how to take it a step further and really market that idea and sell the whole process to clients.

I hope to find a role that I love and something that I’ll look forward to contributing to everyday.
","I mostly resonate with 'success through collaboration' since teamwork has been an active part of my life through many extracurriculars. I think the greatest experience for me was being a part of the student executive committee for the Blue Ocean Competition. While we faced some internal team related issues in terms of communicating with the true directors and sponsors with the organization, most of the student team was left with no responsibility and uncertain expectations. I took the initiative to create simple communication bridges between upper executive directors through meetings where we conversed over our goals and expectations of each other. We retrieved old organization data from previous years and I worked on developing a process roadmap where we created work logs, competition statistics, student engagement, etc. Data about each activity and process was accessible to each team clearing up responsibilities and it was easy to set effective goals. When there were really all hands on deck, we were able to function at our highest capabilities and steadily increase our competitor count that year. In essence, although it's simple, I found that with clear communication and set expectation with each and every individual can help a team function a lot better and reach its goals.

More so, I can choose a specific focus and dive deep into an area of interest through the project groups, while still having opportunities for exploration between the groups.

Additional: Job as event management assistant at Cal Athletics","Not a traditional cover, but this is how I’d tackle the following issue:
“The Boeing Company, a major aerospace and aircraft manufacturer, is facing significant
challenges including safety concerns, quality control issues, and regulatory scrutiny. To restore
its reputation and rejuvenate operations, Boeing needs to prioritize one area for improvement.
Choose a specific issue (e.g., safety, quality control) that Boeing should address first and
propose 1-2 strategic changes to tackle this issue. Consider factors such as budget,
implementation timeline, potential impact, and how to measure success. Support your
suggestions with insights from external sources.”
My plan:-
Issue: Brand Image and Trust
The primary issue Boeing should address is its tarnished brand image, which has caused
widespread mistrust among potential customers. This lack of trust is detrimental to the
company's operations, as safety concerns directly impact the willingness of passengers to
choose Boeing for their travel needs.
Proposed Strategic Alterations
Alteration 1: Transparency and Communication
Details: Boeing should launch a dedicated section on its official website addressing major tragic
events involving its aircraft over the past three years. This section should provide detailed
explanations about the causes of these incidents, emphasizing that many were due to factors
unrelated to engineering faults. Additionally, Boeing should compare its safety statistics with
those of other major airlines, highlighting that such incidents are not unique to Boeing but occur
across the industry.
Budget: This initiative is cost-effective as it primarily involves website development and content
creation.
Timeline: This can be implemented relatively quickly, within a few weeks.
Impact: This transparency will help rebuild trust by showing that Boeing is addressing issues
head-on and is committed to safety.
Measurement: Success can be measured through increased website traffic, improved customer
perception, and positive feedback on Boeing’s transparency.
Alteration 2: On-Board and Airport Communication
Details: Boeing should place posters on all aircraft and in airport terminals that state the
company has met all air safety regulations as verified by relevant authorities. This will serve as a
visible reassurance to passengers.
Budget: This is a low-cost initiative involving printing and placement of posters.
Timeline: This can be rolled out in parallel with the website updates.
Impact: The presence of these posters will provide immediate reassurance to passengers and
reinforce Boeing’s commitment to safety.
Measurement: Success can be gauged by monitoring passenger feedback and conducting
surveys to assess the impact on their confidence in flying with Boeing.
Alteration 3: Customer Feedback and Incentives
Details: Implement a system where passengers are encouraged to review their flight experience
with Boeing via a short message after their flight. Offer a small discount on future flights as an
incentive for providing feedback.
Budget: Minimal cost for implementing the feedback system and managing discounts.
Timeline: Can be introduced as a part of the post-flight experience immediately.
Impact: This will help Boeing collect valuable data on customer perceptions and identify areas
for improvement, while also encouraging repeat business.
Measurement: Success can be measured by the volume and quality of feedback received and
the impact on repeat bookings.
Analysis
Feasibility: All proposed alterations are feasible with minimal budget requirements and can be
implemented quickly. The transparency and communication strategies are expected to improve
brand perception significantly, while the feedback system will provide actionable insights.
Impact: By addressing transparency and reinforcing safety measures, Boeing can begin to
rebuild trust with its customers. Collecting feedback and offering incentives will help Boeing
understand and address customer concerns more effectively.

Be Tenacious                                                                                                                                                         High school brought an unexpected twist into the mix of tests and textbooks-I found myself in a school without a girls' volleyball team. My heart beat for volleyball, and I wasn't about to let the absence of a team squash that passion. So, armed with stubborn determination, I set out to fill the void.

Creating a team from scratch was a bit like piecing together a puzzle without a picture to guide you. There were doubters, raised eyebrows, but I wasn't one to shy away from a challenge. I scoured classrooms, rounding up girls who, like me, held a flicker of interest in volleyball. It was a motley crew, but it was our motley crew.

Being captain wasn't just about leading on the court; it was about donning the coach's hat too. No official coach for our school? No problem. The internet became my coaching companion. Night after night, I delved into online tutorials, soaking in techniques, strategies, and everything that could give us an edge. The next day, I'd stumble into practice, dragging my body to implement those newfound lessons.

Teaching a sport I'd never been officially coached in was a challenge. There were always team disagreements; some fought over the setter position, some over serves, and others over spikes. But being a good leader meant finding common ground by making decisions that were best for the team, whilst keeping good team spirit alive.

Wearing the dual hats of captain and coach filled me with pride; through both roles, I shared with the team the indescribable love I had for volleyball, and that meant everything. Utilizing every free moment as a practice opportunity-whether during lunch breaks, free periods, after school, or weekends-became our routine. From the setback of being eliminated in our first semifinal to the triumphant moment of finally holding that state school championship trophy, every sacrifice and every extra moment spent practicing was undeniably worth it. This victory wasn't just a win; it was a powerful statement. A group of passionate girls, self-coached through YouTube tutorials, boldly etched their names in the state school championship's history.",Business Development,Strategy,Finance,https://drive.google.com/open?id=1gnVnFCoqSbE_q16c4bmwQjiw51MlUdLH,Handbill/Flyer,Asian (including Indian subcontinent and Philippines origin),,14,14.0

Being on a team with tight deadlines and making real-world contributions is a rare opportunity for a college student, and it would provide me with the experience and knowledge to get a head start in my career. Learning how to collaborate with people who have varying levels of experience in a wide range of fields, and learning to trust their work, is incredibly important to me.
	Another key reason is the extensive alumni network. The club’s 50-year alumni database is an impressive achievement that few others can boast. Access to the wealth of experience and mentorship available is invaluable when starting our careers, and I would eagerly take advantage of it.
While most consulting clubs offer strong mentorship, cool projects, and fun retreats—ABA certainly excels at all of those—the biggest reason I want to join ABA is the kindness and warmth of its members.
From the atmosphere of the very first info session and the visible enthusiasm for ABA’s core value, ABALove, I knew this was where I wanted to be. A community that's dedicated towards advancing themselves, without compromising their values, and working hard while still prioritizing life’s more important aspects is exactly what I’m looking for. Every member I spoke to knew exactly what they wanted to do and how they would achieve it, yet they weren’t stressed. Instead, they talked about the more fun, non-school, and non-professional aspects of their lives.
	There are many good reasons to join ABA, but the most special one is the great community I would be stepping into.","ABA’s second core value, Learn and Give Back, is arguably the most important. Learning has always been present in my life and I’ve luckily always had the opportunity to use my knowledge and skills to help others. As a young twelve year old, I felt like a baby and out of place when I walked into my first Boy Scout meeting. All these older highschool Juniors and Seniors towered over me like giants, with an unapproachable air and seemingly unattainable confidence. However, the first guy I made eye contact with immediately came over to greet me. Over the next few years, him and the other seniors coached me through every aspect of Scouting. Their mentorship culminated in me proudly achieving my Eagle Scout which would have been all but impossible without their guidance.
 I didn’t just walk away after achieving that milestone. It became my responsibility to lead the next generation. I was given a group of younger scouts to mentor, and I successfully guided them with the same warmth and patience I had received.
More recently, I’ve been able to give back to another aspect of my life that is dear to my heart. As Vice President of Cal Lacrosse, we have been organizing a plan to create a program to help underprivileged students in Oakland gain access to the wonderful sport of lacrosse.  Our hope is that they will not only learn how to play lacrosse, but also receive mentorship that could one day lead them to play and learn here at Berkeley.",NPO,Strategy,Marketing,https://drive.google.com/open?id=1tiTPB8soyzjqpuNW4z94Nm-JdRDv1UKv,"Handbill/Flyer, Friend","Asian (including Indian subcontinent and Philippines origin), White",,14,15.0

","Like many people applying, I hadn’t heard of ABA until I received a flyer at a tabling event last week. Out of curiosity, I listened to the pitch, and to my surprise, I was genuinely intrigued. I found myself connected to the ideas and projects that ABA was involved in. I wanted to get involved in them and be a part of it too. Through my prior experiences in high school, from my first internship at Vista Optical to my most recent one at Microsoft, I have created and polished my skills in the data analytics field. I have also participated in extracurriculars such as baseball and volunteer work, which align with the values that ABA preaches. Thus, I hope to connect my experiences and use the mentorship offered to excel them into more impactful real-world applications. 
What attracts me most to ABA is the opportunity to connect with a network of driven individuals, from fellow members to alumni, who can guide me on my journey. The brotherhood within ABA is something I value, as it fosters a supportive environment where I can build meaningful relationships while excelling academically and professionally. Although I may not yet have all the skills I need to step into the professional world, I am eager to learn, compete, and network within ABA to eventually apply my open mindset and hard work to be trained under ABA's unique brotherhood.","I resonate with #GAIN&GIVE. A simple but more in-depth and personal meaning. I strongly believe in the concept of teaching the younger generation and giving back to those who once helped you. I don't have the prior skills or experience to jump straight into the consulting field; however, with ABA's great brotherhood and mentorship, skills can be sharpened and developed. I seek to do this at ABA as I hope to learn the essential skills and eventually give back later.
In high school, I founded a pet-sitting business in remembrance of my own dog, Bebe, who suffered a spinal cord pinch five years ago due to mistreatment when we had a local family pet-sit her. She cannot walk on all fours and limps around the house, which inspired me to start this business of mine. I sought to show others that through proper and respectful care, a positive experience can come out of it. Likewise, back in Seattle, I was the head of food management and job consulting for the homeless community. I helped set homeless people up with jobs even though I couldn’t even apply for jobs, I gave out hygiene necessities and helped the homeless live in a better place, uncaring that I was younger or more immature than them. What brought me joy was the upbringing of others, and this is what I hope to accomplish here at ABA, I seek to do it no where else.

While my primary goal is to gain valuable professional experience, particularly in finance, marketing, or NPO, I also want to explore different roles and see what really fits with me. I’m particularly interested in investment banking and want to develop the skills required to succeed in this field. I believe ABA will provide me with the practical experiences and resources necessary to further my career goals, while also allowing me to grow within a supportive and engaging team environment. What sets ABA apart is the opportunity to work with people who can become friends rather than just colleagues. I think that this environment will not only make the learning process more enjoyable but also more effective. Working with a group of friends for me is highly motivating and will enhance my ability to absorb new skills and knowledge in my areas of interest. ","Among ABA’s five core values, three align with me the most: Just Serious Enough, Success Through Collaboration, and Learn and Give Back. In Dragon Boat, I often found myself stepping into a leadership role despite not holding an official title. With my extensive experience, I’ve helped coach and mentor other paddlers, ensuring the team was both prepared and enjoying themselves. Dragon Boat embodies the spirit of being Just Serious Enough—where we have fun as a team but work even harder to deliver our best performance on race day. Success Through Collaboration speaks to my experiences in high school as well. When others were hesitant to take on demanding roles, I stepped up as senior class president and yearbook editor. These positions allowed me to collaborate with teams, manage/distribute responsibilities, and ensure successful results. Finally, Learn and Give Back has been a big part of my Dragon Boat and Key Club experiences. In Dragon Boat, I’ve passed on my knowledge to newer paddlers, growing the team while creating a supportive environment. Similarly, as founder and president of the Galileo Key Club, I focused on empowering the next group of leaders and making sure the club continued to thrive. Through these experiences, I’ve learned that success comes from balancing fun with hard work, leading through collaboration, and sharing knowledge with others.

As someone looking to build a career in the corporate sector, I believe my time at ABA will help nurture my professional skills, better prepare me for interviews, and provide me with technical skills that will be applied in the workforce. Additionally, by participating in various projects, I hope to gain a better understanding as to which business sector suits me best, whether that is Finance, Marketing, or Project Development. 

Additionally, my experience attending ABA’s info session really solidified my interest in the club. I was extremely drawn to how welcoming the club felt, and how each cabinet member and senior consultant embodied the motto “Just Serious Enough.” Therefore, I hope by being part of ABA, I will learn to not take everything too seriously and adapt a work hard, play hard balance in life which can help prevent future burnouts.","For example, as the President of Galileo BuildOn, a volunteering club aimed to give back to the San Francisco community, I prioritized checking in with my cabinet members to ensure they were in the right headspace to accomplish their workload for the week. One time, the Social Vice President was concerned that she might not be able to complete the infographics in time due to her academic workload, so she came to me looking for help. Understanding her struggles, I suggested asking the Historian of our club, who was familiar with working on infographics, if she could complete them in time, and she gladly was free that day so she was able to complete it. 

Additionally, I am currently still in contact with the new cabinet members of Galileo BuildOn. I left them my contact information so they could have someone experienced to rely on when they need help, either with the club or in their personal life, because I understand how daunting it could be holding meetings with 30 or more people and reaching out to well-known organizations to coordinate events.

However, I am passionate about finance and community service, so I hope to be able to work alongside those types of teams at ABA.  I love reading finance news and following the financial markets.  For the past three years, I volunteered extensively with Society For The Blind, a California based nonprofit that aims to empower the visually impaired and blind communities.  Although I have started college now, I still volunteer for the organization daily through remote work!  I also love meeting new people, whether it be on the social or professional side, and I believe consulting is a great opportunity to do so.  I learned about ABA by talking to Hilary at the Sproul table.  She told me a lot about the community that ABA offers on top of professional preparation.  ABA offers just what I want to find as a new student figuring things out at UC Berkeley: career preparation, technical skill improvement, and a fun loving community to do all of this with.  From my team experience with ABA, I hope to gain not just teammates but friends, as well.  And as someone from an immigrant family, I do not know anything about how to prepare for life after college, so I hope that ABA and its alumni network can assist me with turning my eager to learn attitude and determination into successful post college plans in the finance industry.","Of AVA’s five core values, “Be Humble, Be Ambitious, Be Tenacious” best describes me.  These three traits have described a lot of my past experiences, including how I landed two summer internships at boutique wealth management firms.  Although this accomplishment pales in comparison to others’ many successes, it is something I am proud of for pushing myself to take chances and be proactive.  During high school, I hoped to gain internship experience to turn my long term interest in finance into something more professional.  In my cold email draft, I stayed humble by acknowledging the fact that I knew so little.  I was also not afraid to crack some humor by expressing complete excitement to just spend my time at the company with basic office work, such as photocopying reports.    At the same time, I stayed ambitious.  At the high school I went to, most of my peers’ internships came completely from familial relationships, which I did not have.  This further motivated me to push myself in looking for more companies and sending more cold emails.  Meanwhile, I was tenacious in the face of rejection.  With all of the cold emails, I received many polite declines.  Some told me I was too young.  Some told me their firms never take on interns.  Some did not bother to respond.  Each email was hard to take, but I did not give up on my hopes.

My current goal at Berkeley is to drop out by the end of junior year to start a botany company that optimizes plant growth using ML models. Learning the skills needed to achieve my goal solely through classes is too limited by prerequisites and the lecture-based education style, which is why I aim to accelerate my learning by engaging in hands-on projects that tackle practical challenges in the sustainability industry—something ABA uniquely offers at an exceptional level within Berkeley. While many technical clubs like ML@B and Launchpad focus on specific aspects of the skills I aim to master, reviewing ABA’s multi-layered projects showed me how technical skills and corporate strategies can be simultaneously emphasized. For instance, ABA’s project with UNIQLO involved both market/user research and data analysis, which is exactly the type of learning opportunity I am looking for in order to develop a well-rounded technical palette. 

I envision contributing to ABA by adding my drop of entrepreneurial spirit to the diverse community. I’m naturally curious about anything unfamiliar and often invite those around me to explore or learn new things together.

A blur of playground goodbyes and first-day jitters marked my journey through seven elementary and middle schools. Navigating unfamiliar social circles often left me feeling on the periphery, but it taught me the importance of both receiving and creating inclusivity. 

My experiences inspired me to found my school’s Model UN team during my sophomore year of high school. The public forum-styled activity inherently promoted my ideal of inclusivity, whether it’s attracting newly arrived international students or serving as a space for shy classmates to find their voice.  Rather than being so preoccupied with fundraising and preparing for competitions like so many of the clubs I had engaged with, I focused on building a team. We hung out after meetings, ate out together, and exchanged funny memories. What seemed like a group of twenty students drafting solutions to global issues every Wednesday afternoon, was actually a community of friends where diverse opinions and ideas flowed freely. On issues such as healthcare, members felt comfortable sharing personal experiences regarding costs and discrimination, creating more inclusive discourse. I learned that my commitment to finding enjoyment in the things I do inadvertently benefitted the quality of my endeavors. Though I have now graduated, I often reconnect with the team and am greatly pleased by the tightly-knit community that continues to empower each other to find their voice.

All of which promise the same thing: professional development, fortune 500 projects, internships, and community. Thus, I feel like there’s no reason to write about most of these promises. However, I would like to focus on one–community. As I attended various “meet the organizations” and info sessions, a common sentiment shared by members was that they highly valued the bonds they built with their club peers. So what makes ABA different? The answer I’ve come up with: Me. I’m sure all of these clubs have lovely, tight-knit communities–however, the real question is whether it’s the right community for me. ABA was the only club which made me feel comfortable in my own skin–I didn’t feel pressure to keep my corporate guard up for long. From a welcoming Q&A with Erin at my orientation to my coffee chat with Chloe to meeting many more members, y’all are just chill like that. This is the type of community I want to be a part of.

With that being said, I hope to build lifelong friendships and find a home at ABA over the next four years. ABA's alignment with my career goals, especially its flexibility to explore different teams, will help me clarify my career direction. Furthermore, I look forward to contributing not only to impactful projects but also to the ABA community.
","Community is everything to me–and the fact that four of the five ABA core values reflect this draws me in. As I reflect on my own journey, #GAIN&GIVE is a value that stuck out to me.

In high school, the Business, Entrepreneurship, and Innovation (BEI) program became a cornerstone of my academic experience. BEI, a thriving business community with programs like DECA and an incubator, became my second home. It’s where I found my community and formed close friendships with ambitious students and inspiring mentors who fueled my passion for business.

As a timid underclassman, BEI provided a sanctuary through classes like Business Fundamentals and Entrepreneurship for Social Impact. My teachers, who were also my DECA advisors, nurtured my interest in business–and upperclassmen offered support that made my early years joyful. By the end of my sophomore year, my connection with BEI deepened. I took on a leadership role in DECA and began leading projects in the Incubator program.

These experiences allowed me to give back to a program that shaped who I am today. As I look back now, I feel immense pride and gratitude. In my senior year, I expanded my role by mentoring younger students and strengthening the community spirit of BEI. This journey, filled with personal growth, invaluable friendships, and leadership opportunities, will forever be a cherished chapter of my life.

This passion deepened during MasterCard China's annual case competition, where my team and I worked late into the night to create impactful strategies for our client. That experience taught me that success isn’t just about individual achievement—it’s about uplifting others, sharing knowledge, and creating lasting value as a team. Our collaborative effort earned us the Best Presentation award and cemented my desire to be part of a community that supports and empowers each other.

At Haas, I found that same spirit in ABA. Ellie Hwang’s recommendation prompted me to explore the organization, and conversations with David Lee and Anh-Thu highlighted how ABA fosters a culture of mentorship and giving back. David emphasized the importance of older students passing on their experiences, while Anh-Thu shared how the group’s team dynamics create an environment of mutual learning and growth. These interactions convinced me that ABA isn’t just about professional development but building a supportive, close-knit community.

I’m excited about the chance to contribute to ABA, where every project is an opportunity to learn, lead, and give back to the community that empowers us. Through its collaborative environment and culture of shared learning, I see ABA as the ideal place to combine my passion for strategy and community while creating lasting connections.","The core values I relate to the most are learning and giving back. I remember celebrating with my family upon receiving my internship offer in college. However, I soon realized I was one of the few privileged students with a business internship while attending my community college. This experience exposed me to community college students' challenges in accessing traditional business recruiting. I became determined to host Pasadena City College's first Meet The Firms Career Fair. 

I initially invited local university admissions officers to establish a partnership supporting students' professional journeys after community college. Working directly with universities helped me present the diverse backgrounds of community college students as a compelling proposition to hiring managers. In preparation for the event, I noticed many of my peers needed to gain familiarity with LinkedIn and resume formatting. To remedy this, I invited former USC faculty and local employers to host elaborate workshops teaching how to leverage LinkedIn and prepare for recruiting events.

After nine months of preparation, my team and I hosted my community college's first Meet the Firms. The event drew over 200 students and 15 companies, successfully bridging marginalized students to opportunities. The event began the Big Four's long-term commitment to Pasadena City College, ensuring business students the chance to accelerate their professional careers. With a fundraising surplus, I set aside $3,500 to help teach students to begin giving back through new initiatives.

I want to gain a deep understanding of diverse consulting methods and tools so I can analyze complex problems, develop strategies, and implement solutions that make a substantial and positive impact on individuals, organizations, and communities. 
To me, consulting is about using business principles and acumen to improve the lives of others, whether that’s propelling a business’s growth, helping a nonprofit to better serve its community, or supporting individuals in achieving their goals. Aside from the technical skills, I’m most excited about the opportunity to connect with like-minded individuals. I want to find a group of people who are as passionate about learning as I am.

When I first joined SMYC, I had minimal knowledge on how to deal with these issues. But by working with my fellow commissioners, I learned how to set up town halls for community members to voice their concerns, fundraise for student wellness programs, write proposals to bring sustainability initiatives to local schools, and help provide over $40,000 in scholarships to underprivileged immigrant youth.

SMYC strengthened my confidence as a leader and equipped me with the skills to start my own service project. During my conservation work with a nonprofit called Mountain Watch, I learned about their desire to restore the habitat of a lesser-known but ecologically important species called the Elfin Butterfly. I decided to spearhead an Elfin Butterfly Education and Restoration Project that involved recruiting volunteers for Mountain Watch and writing a comprehensive project proposal that I took to the ElfenWorks Foundation, which funds community service projects. Securing $60,000 to revive the Elfin Butterfly was immensely rewarding and showed me how giving back teaches you valuable lessons that only make you a stronger leader and community contributor.",NPO,Business Development,Strategy,https://drive.google.com/open?id=1Cn01ZTt8gbcH7Jqvfk_7fKGG-P8zpwnK,"Handbill/Flyer, Friend",Asian (including Indian subcontinent and Philippines origin),,14,15.0

I am interested in pursuing a career in actuary or accounting in the future, and ABA provides a great opportunity for me to get a head start. 

But what attracted me the most about ABA was how social everyone was. After attending my first informational session on Tuesday, I realized that although all the members maintained a sense of professionalism, interacting with them was relaxing, friendly, and interactive. I find that for me, the ABA closed-knit community will provide a sense of belonging and family here at Berkeley. 

From the projects, I hope to gain hands-on experience and knowledge about business principles. All the project managers seem knowledgeable and passionate about their roles, so I hope to gain valuable insight and advice about business and life in general. I also hope that I can contribute ideas by providing some of the knowledge I have from being an entrepreneurial Girl Scout and running high school clubs. Additionally, I aim to improve my professional skills by applying creativity, collaborating as a team, and utilizing public speaking. 

Overall, I am excited for this opportunity to meet and collaborate with new people, while growing professionally to align with my future career goals. ","ABA’s value of “Be Humble, Be Ambitious, Be Tenacious” best describes me. In high school senior year, I became the Co-Captain of the girls’ tennis team. Tasked to lead us to a West Alameda County Conference Shoreline championship, I had to step up and learn. I did so by implementing new practice methods that fit each player’s level. I also listened to the recommendations of my teammates such as a request to implement more dynamic stretches and changing our main platform of communication. 

Being the Co-Capitan has taught me that besides directing, a competent leader is someone who can listen to suggestions. My efforts in implementing new practices and accepting change contributed to creating a more cohesive team. We cheered on each other during games more often and frequently created new friendships with different teammates, helping us grow closer together. Ultimately, we were rewarded with a team victory in the Girls Tennis WACC Shoreline league. Now, whenever I am clueless about executing a task or goal, I always ask for ideas and suggestions from the people around me. 

Also, when weekly volunteering at a public library, I often taught others how to catalog the alphabetical book system and manage program booths. But I also constantly learned from my peers such as how to operate a Cricut machine to create monthly holiday decorations. 

My skills and experience will continue to aid me when working in a team environment, whether I am the person to lead or the person to stay back and listen.",NPO,Finance,Business Development,https://drive.google.com/open?id=1xTJYml_ceaT6qMvvgC1eZ7BJqWqoq1-Y,"Handbill/Flyer, Calapalooza",Asian (including Indian subcontinent and Philippines origin),,13,15.0

I really resonate with ABA’s emphasis on education, as I want to pursue my interests by engaging in experiential learning because I find fulfillment in challenging myself to grow. I’m especially excited about ABA’s value of giving back because of the opportunity to join a strong network for guidance, mentorship, and expertise to guide me on my personal journey. Additionally, I’d really value ABA’s professional development to improve my confidence in interviews, casing, and public speaking to prepare me for the future. 

The information sessions and coffee chats made it clear that ABA's members and executive team are driven by passion, excitement, and fun. I was especially intrigued by hearing recollections of the opportunity to experience the versatility of rotating through different committees in order to gain well rounded insights to business. 

But besides my interest in entrepreneurship and business, the main factor driving me to apply is my love for connecting with others and finding fulfillment in activities that reflect my passion for growth. I want to be part of the tight-knit community that ABA has to offer. I’m excited to meet people that share similar interests as me to make my time at Berkeley fun and memorable. Joining ABA would challenge me professionally and personally, allowing me to grow while offering a rewarding experience. ","ABA’s pillar of success through collaboration resonates with me the most. I played competitive volleyball for the past seven years, in high school and now on Berkeley's club team, which taught me the importance of teamwork and selflessness when working towards a goal in collaboration. My position, the setter, especially demands collaboration as I am in charge of the second out of three contacts, managing communication with passers while also delivering accurate sets for the hitters. I realized that I couldn’t afford to get down on myself as I have such great responsibility with my role in the game, which comes with a lot of pressure. I learned the importance of supporting my teammates not only when they do great, but more importantly, uplifting them when they make mistakes, displaying my unwavering belief in them but also providing constructive feedback when needed. This made me feel more confident on the court and perform better in games as we fostered a supportive and accountable environment. Leading by example, I give my best effort during practices, take responsibility for mistakes, and encourage my teammates to do the same in order to push others constructively to meet our goals. 

In a college setting, volleyball has taught me the value of being a good teammate in all that I pursue. I approach challenges with a positive outlook while also supporting others around me. Thus, success through collaboration allows me to be a better teammate, friend, and leader.

I did know that I wanted to explore healthcare and business, as I admire both. The first time I talked to ABA at tabling, my mind was blown by how a student organization can have such an impact on big companies. Listening to the types of opportunities that members get and the things they accomplish blew my mind even more. I would love the opportunity to be a member because this group will help me professionally develop, explore careers, and obtain a supportive community. I want to find my passion through ABA. I also want to gain experience and explore different fields through ABA. I have a lot of history within working with teams, from sports, clubs, and local community service. I feel that teamwork is essential to any group, and I hope to become even better at teamwork through ABA, as it is a skill I will use for the rest of my life. Talking to members at the info session gave me a perspective of how the tightness of the community is within ABA. In my coffee chat with Paul, I received personal and deep advice which showed me the supportiveness and professionalism of ABA. This group has by far a better network than other clubs and from what I have seen, an amazing family that I could see myself being a part of. ","In the five core values, I feel that the one that most resonates with me is success through collaboration. Being able to work with other people on a collective problem, while building a bond is something I really admire. One example of this is how I collaborated with others to create a golf team. My interest in golf developed in my early years of high school and is something I love to participate in today. At my brand new and underrepresented high school, golf wasn't a sport offered. My friends and I wanted to play and give people the opportunity to play at my school, so I took the initiative. It seemed overwhelming to try to create a golf team from the ground up, but I knew that it would pay off. I began to work with our AD to officially create a team at my high school. To do this, I founded the golf club after finding enough people to be a part of it, as well as a staff member who later became our coach. In the club, I led multiple fundraisers to raise enough money to pay league dues, and eventually become an official team in the local league. This wasn’t easy, but I had the help of my peers. We all worked together on a collective task, which made the process much easier. This past season, I was varsity captain and helped lead our team to a winning season as well as a league championship title.",Business Development,Marketing,Strategy,https://drive.google.com/open?id=19iVE2oF2SqZYl4T2dq9rQPLdvCIl8uOR,"Handbill/Flyer, Calapalooza",Asian (including Indian subcontinent and Philippines origin),"My hometown is “The Salad Bowl of the World”, Salinas, Ca, where the population is 80 percent hispanic and almost half of the land is used for agriculture. Being Gujarati, I looked different, spoke different, and lived differently. I remember the first time someone asked if I had a “bomb in my backpack,” or if my family “owned the 7/11 across the street.” Despite this, the sense of confusion and exclusion are what I remembered most. The incessant symphony of this debasing confusion kept my head down, silencing my voice whenever there was a chance to connect. I never understood the Spanish language that had everyone in the class laughing; I held a fake laugh just to fit in. There were times where I was told “Hey Steven, say something in Indian.” I didn’t tell them I spoke Gujarati, I couldn’t stand to hear my language disrespected. I never felt so obscured, so I started to suppress my culture. This all changed when I started to volunteer for the Indian Community of Monterey Bay-a non-profit that holds events for my Indian community. Here I began to accept and celebrate my culture and positively shape my identity. Growing from this challenge is the most important part of my identity today. I wasn’t afraid to be my true self anymore. It helped me develop the way I think, speak, and respect others.

I did not join rowing for the 4:30am wakeup, I joined because I knew every person on the team that would wake up at that time would be disciplined and intrinsically motivated. Researching ABA these past semesters, I picked up that the common value was moral integrity and not sacrificing personal values for anything. This club seems to account for so many different interests, but it all is rooted in  a desire to create a foundation for skills in business while also prioritizing each other's well being. I hope to gain a sense of community while also building up my understanding of the business and consulting world. The possibility of working and learning from not only major companies, but my fellow peers is an opportunity I do not want to pass up. ","Take care of each other. I connect with people by oversharing. You could have a conversation with me for 5 minutes and I would say “this is TMI but…” This helps me connect with people because it provides a sense of comfort that everything is on the table to talk about. I always try to create a supportive, open, and comedic environment so people feel like they can be themselves and come to me for anything, whether advice or just a hug. Talking about anything and everything openly and judgment free is the way I and my loved ones take care of each other because it reminds us that we have a safe and supportive space. At the end of the day we are human beings, we have to support one another. I remember telling one of my best friends, right when we met, about this completely insane interaction I had with someone I met on a dating app that I thought was a completely unique experience.

Latino Pre-Law Society","        It’s been a busy week of coffee chats and info sessions for more clubs than I can count, but my biggest takeaway from the students I’ve met has been some version of the following: “At the end of the day, all of the consulting clubs do the same thing.” This typically gets followed up with something along the lines of, “You just have to find the people that you click with the most.”

        So far, ABA has been that club for me. As a transfer student, I found that many other consulting clubs were slightly discouraging; one hadn’t even accepted new transfers in over a year. With ABA, however, I felt genuinely welcome. Talking to another transfer student who joined ABA in his spring semester was also reassuring that even as a transfer, I still have the opportunity to apply again next semester.

        Of course, the professional aspect that ABA offers is equally important. Over my next two and a half years at Berkeley, my hope is to further immerse myself in the business world and gain hands-on experience in consulting, especially for nonprofits. Getting to collaborate with like-minded peers on projects like these will not only be a way for me to enhance my skills, but also to apply them in ways that have a tangible impact. Overall, I am confident that ABA can be the perfect place for me to grow both personally and professionally.","        “Success through collaboration” is the ABA value that I have embraced the most throughout my life. Whether at work, in extracurriculars, or in the classroom, learning what it means to take the lead and effectively collaborate with a team is applicable in almost any scenario.

        Throughout high school, being on the Mock Trial team was easily my favorite extracurricular, but stepping into leadership roles came with its challenges. As the club president, I managed both our Prosecution and Defense subteams. Whether it was coordinating with coaches to set schedules and deadlines, managing club finances, or organizing scrimmages with other schools, there was always something to be done. To add on to all this, I still had to complete my own statements and examinations in preparation for competition.

        Serving as the Mock Trial president was undoubtedly my most demanding leadership position, but it was also the one that taught me the most. I learned how to lead effectively and delegate tasks to the rest of my leadership team while being an active member alongside everyone else. It came down to finding a balance between fulfilling my leadership responsibilities and meeting my personal deadlines as a team member, something that I couldn’t have accomplished without relying on the people around me. To put it in ABA terms, it was about being #InIt2gether. My leadership and organizational skills have always been strong, but experiences like this one have allowed me to employ those skills and develop them even further.",NPO,Strategy,Marketing,https://drive.google.com/open?id=1OjtjmPH1828hNFWObQyJZWRYAlWRV7zG,"Instagram, Friend",LatinX,"I graduated from high school in 2023 and transferred to UC Berkeley in one year, so my current expected graduation term is Spring 2026; however, I am planning on taking an extra semester and staying through Fall 2026.",15,15.0

During my first experience casing with ABA at the workshop, I saw how powerful collaboration can be. The workshop focused on a case for a fictional high-end children's apparel brand, Rainbow Apparel. I felt a sense of synergy, much like in a game when a team works seamlessly together. The environment was open and inclusive, where no idea was considered ""bad"", allowing everyone to share their thoughts freely.
As we worked through the case, I found myself in a supportive role, assessing the group dynamic and building on others suggestions. I enjoyed how naturally our plan of action fell into place, much like strategizing in a game where every player’s input is essential. This collaborative approach, where each member's ideas were valued, allowed us to form a comprehensive strategy for Rainbow Apparel.
My experience in ABA’s casing workshop mirrored the dynamics of playing Support in games like League of Legends, where anticipating teammates’ needs and enhancing their strengths is crucial. I hope to bring this mindset to ABA, focusing on collaboration, adaptability, and creating an inclusive environment. By learning from my peers and contributing my unique perspective, I believe I can help the team achieve its goals, much like how a well-played support character enables a team to win.","Among ABA's core values, ""Learn and Give Back"" best represents me. This value resonates with my journey in dance, where learning from others and sharing my knowledge has been a central theme. Three years ago, when I first joined a dance studio, I struggled with stiffness, and my movements looked unnatural. With the consistent support and understanding of my instructors, I grew more confident in dance. Their dedication to my growth was so impactful that I was eventually offered a job at the studio.
Inspired by my instructors, I sought to give back by founding a dance club at my academically focused high school, targeting low-income, first-generation students. In club meetings, I taught dance to students who were learning for the first time, just as my instructors had done for me. This experience taught me the importance of mentorship, patience, and creating an inclusive environment where everyone feels supported.
I see a parallel between this experience and the business world. In both, growth comes from a continuous cycle of learning from those around you and giving back by uplifting others. Just as I helped new dancers find confidence, I hope to bring this value to ABA by learning from my peers, contributing my insights, and supporting the team in achieving collective success.",Business Development,Strategy,Marketing,Marketing,Handbill/Flyer,Asian (including Indian subcontinent and Philippines origin),,14,14.0

The most important part of a club or organization is the connection between the people within it, and ABA is outstanding in that department. I felt comfortable speaking to all of the members at the case workshop, and everyone was eager to answer my questions. Moreover, during the case workshop, the obvious camaraderie and connection that the members had towards each other was admirable. As I begin my Berkeley journey, I aim to build similar bonds. I want to build bonds that go beyond the professional sphere and allow me to make genuine connections with friends. I hope to meet people who have similar interests to me in the professional space, such as business and economics, but also in the social aspect. I want my team experience to be constructive and rigorous—something that forges the best version of myself, but in a space where corrections come from friends.

I hope my team is one that is willing to both learn and grow alongside me and isn’t afraid to challenge me. I hope that everyone finds purpose in the work we do together and genuinely cares about the impact.","All five of the core values that ABA expresses are similar to my personal values. I believe in taking care of those you work with or hang out with because, at the end of the day, if they can’t rely on you, then you shouldn’t expect to rely on them. In a team, you might need to be a leader or a pupil at the same time, so being humble and able to accept fault is imperative. I believe that you get what you put in, and you give back what you get. As an alum, I believe there is almost an obligation to give back to the community that gave you a shot. Through my past experience of spearheading an environmental justice project in junior year, I was often forced to be both a leader and a student to those aiding the production of the project. This allowed everyone working on the project to provide input in the creative process and led to benefits in efficiency because ideas, including less effective ones, were debated. We took care of all participating members, ensured everyone was comfortable with their assigned work, and helped in any way we could. Once we completed the project and finished off the year, I still felt obligated to help my advisor, so I continued working on minor projects for the organization.

A community that has a genuine desire to see each other succeed, and one which would motivate me to strive for excellence. I am at my best when I am surrounded by driven and goal-oriented people, and I know that I will gain this from a team experience with ABA. Whether it was in high school, in student government or last semester in Chi Psi Excom, I was constantly faced with hardships and failures. But by approaching each challenge with a team mentality, I was able to learn, grow, and make the best decisions for my community.

My background demonstrates that I have a consistent commitment towards creating spaces where peers can engage in problem solving and critical thinking. During the COVID-19 pandemic, I founded the “Critical Thinking Club” at my high school, which was a response to that lack of student clubs and the need for engaging and interactive activities, during a challenging and isolating time. By organizing these sessions where members could analyze contemporary artwork and challenge conventional assumptions, we created a dynamic environment that wanted to encourage critical thinking and collective growth. This initiative brought together around 100 students,  highlighting the power of collaborative efforts in achieving meaningful learning experiences. 

In college, I continued these efforts in my role as a peer tutor with the Math Learning Center, this helped furthered my commitment to supporting peers through collaborative problem solving. I helped students develop study practices, form study groups and navigate through tough academic challenges. Working closely with colleagues and mentees helped enrich my understanding of diverse learning environments and diverse learning needs students may have, reinforcing my belief in the value of teamwork. Joining  ABA would help me gain the opportunity to further these interests by working with a team that will help me learn more about collaboration, professional growth and mutual support. I'm eager to contribute my skills and experiences to ABA's mission, hope to gain a deeper insight into team dynamics, expand problem solving strategies and continue growing as a leader and collaborator. 
","The ABA core value that resonates the most with me is “Success Through Collaboration”. My experiences from highschool to community college reflect my commitment to this value, drawing focus on teamwork, shared leadership, and collective achievement. 

During high school, I interned at an organization called Quest, that was a part of the Government of India’s department of Tribal development in Maharashtra. My team was led by Professor Neeraj Hatekar (Economist), where we researched concerns to address the economic challenges faced by farmers in Maharashtra. Despite being the youngest member, I was welcomed by the team with warmth and love and this helped me embrace collaboration by gathering the confidence to contribute to the project through my language skills, taking on leadership roles. Tasked with translating, compiling data and creating economic indices, I coordinated efforts among team members ensuring accurate and timely delivery. This collaborative experience was important for our successful presentation to the department head, and ultimately led to the publication of our research. Furthermore, I continued to nurture these skills in college in my role as Vice President of Law Society and Business Leaders of Tomorrow clubs further (each for a year long tenure, one followed by another) exemplifying these values. Organizing events like “Shark Tank workshop” helped me to facilitate teamwork amongst members and this helped foster an environment where each person could contribute their skills and ideas to the greater discussion. These experiences and others help reinforce my belief and passion in the power of collective effort through shared commitment.

","As someone looking to break into the fields of consulting and marketing strategy, I feel that ABA is my ideal environment to pursue my professional goals and join a community of like-minded individuals. I founded my own photography business with my twin sister six years ago, and since then, I’ve been in love with the idea of utilizing creative strategies to expand my enterprise to a larger demographic. I want to grow my literacy in the fields of business development, and I hope to apply these skills into the corporate and professional world. 

I love how ABA provides students with the unique opportunity to gain hands-on experience in consulting and marketing, all while offering a genuinely supportive and uplifting environment. Even through simple conversations with members at coffee chats and tabling sessions, I feel truly welcomed by the members of ABA and feel interested in everyone’s experiences in consulting and diverse personal backgrounds. I appreciate ABA’s eager desire to give back to their members and help them grow, both personally and professionally, and I feel that the warm atmosphere of ABA is often rare to find in a corporate space. 

From my team experience, I hope to learn from consultants and project managers to expand my business intuition and acumen, learning the structures of a case framework and how to pinpoint a company’s weaknesses and strengths. I also want to gain more confidence in expressing my ideas and voicing my opinions, rather than shying away from opportunities to speak up. 
","I believe that #ABALove best describes me, as the values of compassion, community, and teamwork have always been central to my life. I grew up in a big family with three siblings, including a twin sister, and I lived in four different states and two continents. Despite how often my family relocated, I never grew up feeling lonely — my siblings taught me how to support others, advocate for my opinions, care for my friends, and most importantly, how to be a good team player. These early childhood experiences solidified my belief learning to respect and communicate with others are the most important skills someone can possess. 

Because of this, I thrive in team environments and love the excitement of exchanging ideas and opinions with a group of diverse-minded people. I consider myself to be very open-minded, and I work best alongside colleagues who value compassion and empathy as much as I do. 

Additionally, I display my love and care for others through my friendships and my family members. When my friends are going through a challenging time, I want to be the first one to extend a helping hand and offer them support. Mental health awareness and promoting empathy is something I am extremely passionate about, and I want to let people know they’re never alone.

","I am excited about the opportunity to join ABA because it closely aligns with my core values: professional growth, meaningful project experiences, and a deep sense of community. The organization’s commitment to fostering personal development and building lifelong connections resonates with my intention to become a well-rounded business leader.

ABA particularly stood out to me because of the genuine friendliness and welcoming atmosphere of this team. It truly felt like I was embraced and unified into the club from the start. 

On the more professional side, I am excited to participate in ABA’s opportunity to strengthen my skills and be part of a well-crafted team. Being able to apply ABA's team-focused concepts to real-world client projects highly appeals to me.

In my role as president of Printed Works and having a skillful team, I was able to generate $30,000 in revenue in our first year by streamlining collaboration and creating efficiency within the club. I am eager to bring my leadership and receptive mindset to ABA, where I aspire to learn and grow alongside the analysts and project managers. By leveraging their perspectives, I aim to broaden my outlook and continue developing both personally and professionally.

My experiences and leadership ultimately led me to discover my passion for finance. ABA’s tight-knit community represents a journey that aligns with my goals of learning and giving back. By joining this incredible ABA family, I am motivated to contribute to the club, build a strong network of peers, and grow both personally and professionally.
","Among ABA’s core values, #GAIN&GIVE resonates with me the most, as it reflects my dedication to growth and community contribution. 

My lack of awareness during COVID led me to join Printed Works, learning the technical and professional skills day by day. Eventually, I took a step into being President by my junior year. The skills and education I gained from the club inspired me to give back. The revenue we earned, we were able to reinvest back into purchasing new machines and hiring instructors to increase the learning experiences for members. This investment not only ensured the club’s growth but also aligned with ABA’s #GAIN&GIVE value. Not only did the #GAIN&GIVE mentality stick with me in Printed Works, but it also led me to direct funds to underfunded school programs, creating meaningful opportunities for other students.

Dronescape, a club I founded in my freshman year, also embodies the #GAIN&GIVE value by meaningfully contributing to our community. The community supported us during our early financial struggles, in return, we made it a priority to give back. One of our most significant contributions was organizing a drone light show that not only provided a safer alternative to traditional fireworks but also brought our community closer together. My top priority has been reinvesting in the club to ensure its growth and a strong foundation after I leave.

These experiences have solidified my commitment to ABA’s #GAIN&GIVE mentality, and I’m eager to bring this mindset to ABA, where I can continue to contribute to both the club’s initiatives and the broader community.",Marketing,NPO,Finance,https://drive.google.com/open?id=1HJ-xgBtctjdVPgVRW6zJ0OhqKfp_oCgw,"Instagram, Website, Handbill/Flyer, Calapalooza",Asian (including Indian subcontinent and Philippines origin),,15,15.0

The mission to develop well-rounded business leaders resonates with me; it's not just about acquiring skills but also about maintaining humility, integrity, and a genuine passion for what we do. Likewise, values like “ABA Love,” “Be Humble, Be Ambitious, Be Tenacious,” and “Just Serious Enough” really resonate with my personal guiding values that I hold dear and aim to practice in my personal and professional life.

Likewise, I really value the rotational aspects of ABA, where I can go through different teams every semester and get to know more people on a personal basis while developing my skills in a bunch of sectors. Furthermore, close professional development in a cohort setting would be instrumental in forming lifelong bonds and gaining everlasting knowledge. Moreover, ABA presents an opportunity for me to gain and give back to others, which aligns with personal values of mentorship, teaching, and volunteering. Lastly, the people in ABA are a great learning outlet. From retreats in nature to casing deep into the night to mock prepping client calls, I’m sure I can learn a lot from the ABA community while making lifelong friends who I love hanging out with. ","Be Humble, Be Ambitious, Be Tenacious: A few semesters ago, I faced an unexpected challenge when I suffered a severe concussion after accidentally being hit in the head. The incident occurred at a crucial time and affected my ability to focus and think critically, significantly slowing my ability to keep up with classes, applications, and personal matters. Severe headaches, migraines, and brain fog were consistent throughout the weeks as I tried to recover. 

However, rather than feeling frustrated and tunnel-visioning about my mistake, I accepted it as a humbling experience. I moved forward with a fresh start, refusing to let this setback prevent me from achieving my ambitions. Following my strict recovery plan, I gradually returned to my other activities. I was laser-focused on improvement, and despite the gradual progress, I remained tenacious. 

As I overcame this challenge, I truly learned the value of persistence, mindfulness, and adaptability, equipping me with the growth mindset I now religiously follow. All told, this transformative experience has not only made me more resilient but has also instilled in me newfound empathy and time management skills, invaluable traits for any future endeavors.",Finance,Business Development,NPO,https://drive.google.com/open?id=1vLgPfoek4UvpsKeJtsen6qWkqCblnXUg,"Instagram, Website, Friend","Asian (including Indian subcontinent and Philippines origin), Middle Eastern",,14,14.0

Among the many consulting organizations on campus, ABA stands out to me with its five diverse project teams, which allow consultants to work on projects that align with their personal and professional interests. The opportunity to work on tailored projects while gaining mentorship from experienced peers is incredibly motivating. Moreover, the Analyst Development Program is also appealing, as it effectively prepares its members for success in the corporate world. 

Beyond professional development, ABA’s commitment to making the most out of each others’ college experience also speaks to me. College is a unique time for building relationships and growing holistically, and I believe ABA offers a supportive community that encourages all forms of development. Conversations with ABA members have shown me how they take pride in being such a tight-knit community. This sense of belonging is further reflected by ABA’s incredible alumni network, with past members frequently returning to give back. This network not only highlights ABA’s exceptional bonds but also emphasizes the valuable professional and networking opportunities it offers. 

By working with a team of passionate and like-minded individuals in business and consulting, I hope to gain not only practical business and leadership skills like strategic thinking and problem-solving, but also lifelong friendships. I’m excited by the opportunity to contribute meaningfully to ABA’s family of driven people who share a love for both hard work and fun.","The ABA core value that best describes me is #InIt2gether. I believe that collaboration is the key to success, whether as a leader or a team member. One of the most formative experiences where I demonstrated this value was through co-founding KidsAbility, a student-led organization based in Hong Kong supporting the children with special needs community. Leading a team of over 30 student volunteers online, I recognized the importance of working together to maximize impact. We collaborated on researching psychological disorders, creating social media campaigns, and hosting sports workshops, all while supporting one another through challenges that came with the pandemic and conflicting schedules. Navigating the difficulties of remote collaboration taught me that asking for help when necessary is not only acceptable but encouraged. It also reinforced the value of communication and taking ownership of my own responsibilities.  

In addition to KidsAbility, my experience as a badminton player has further illustrated this value of teamwork. Regularly playing doubles has taught me the importance of knowing when to take the shot and when to step back and let my partner take charge. It’s all about trusting one another and working seamlessly together in the process.

Through these experiences, I discovered that the best successes come from recognizing each other’s strengths, stepping up when needed, and supporting one another every step of the way. I’m eager to continue bringing this collaborative mindset to the projects I work on and look forward to contributing to ABA’s culture of teamwork and leadership.

My career goal is to break into the tech + business sector and gain experience either through high growth startups or established corporations. Afterwards, I’m bringing the skills learnt back to my home country, Indonesia, to create a Software/EdTech startup where the gaps exist. As a side venture, I plan to build accessible schools throughout Indonesia to increase our literacy rate and place us on the map. As the 4th most populated country, barely anyone knows Indonesia.

ABA is unique because of its long standing history, consisting of an extensive alumni network and socially conscious individuals that further strive to make an impact. After coffee chatting and being part of ABA’s info sessions, I realize that ABA will not only allow me to strive towards my career goals, but more importantly be a part of an extensive but amiable community that strives to improve each other professionally and mentally.","All of it resonate with me but i think Gain and Give best describes me!

Previously, I led a team of mentors to initiate a program at YPAC wherein we taught coding to disabled students. Initially, I assumed our challenge would be to effectively deliver scratch programming and web-design lessons. But upon arriving, I was shocked to find out that most of them were just starting to learn typing.

We completely adapted our approach to incorporate basic digital skills. Our planned 4-week curriculum turned to a 15-week journey, driven by the commitment to make an impact in their lives. In Alif, who faced not only stunted growth but also discrimination, I saw myself. As our sessions progressed, his resilience and inquisitiveness made him the quickest learner, and, gradually, his peers stopped teasing him and even began asking him for help. Today, he actively participates in web-design competitions and leads the computer club at YPAC.

These meaningful projects allow me to give back to the community, where efforts can tangibly impact lives. But it also allows me to gain knowledge and fulfillment. Consulting with real life companies will allow me to broaden my impact and not only positively impact the lives of thousands more, but also allow me to engender a journey of passion, friendship, and fulfillment.

I am also in a sorority!,"Over the summer, I had the opportunity to shadow a company that worked in market sales, which sparked my interest in consulting. However, my time there was limited, and I didn’t gain as much hands-on experience or learn as much as I had hoped. This left me eager to learn more about consulting projects and how to work effectively with a team and client.
When I saw Berkeley ABA tabling on Sproul, I decided to learn more about the club, attend coffee chats, and participate in ABA’s case workshop. Throughout this process, I felt very welcomed by the members and was delighted to hear how team members collaborate, share ideas, and support one another. I was also excited to learn about the five different project groups and the opportunity for new members to interview for their top three projects. The emphasis on collaboration and hands-on experience truly appealed to me, as it aligns with my desire to grow in a supportive environment.
Although I’m a member with less consulting experience, I am eager and motivated to learn, develop practical skills, and contribute alongside my team members. I am excited to immerse myself in Berkeley ABA’s collaborative yet social environment, gain valuable insights into consulting, and make meaningful contributions to the projects. The opportunity to grow both personally and professionally while being surrounded by passionate and warm peers makes me excited to continue with ABA!
","The ABA core value that best describes me is ""Take Care of Each Other."" I deeply believe in supporting those around me and creating an environment where everyone feels valued, included, and respected. This is a principle I have carried with me through various experiences.

For example, during a service project I work on annually in my hometown, I helped organize and host a Christmas party for foster children. Our team fundraise to provide  stockings filled with gifts, and we worked hard to create a joyful, welcoming atmosphere for the kids. My goal was to ensure every child felt seen, cared for, and included, recognizing that even small acts of kindness can have a profound impact. This experience reinforced the importance of empathy, compassion, and building connections in our communities.
Similarly, as a past dance teacher, my goal was to create a nurturing environment where my students, ranging in age from 4 to 17, could express themselves freely and learn from one another. I took the time to understand each student's unique needs and found ways to support them, whether by creating a positive atmosphere in the studio or by offering extra help when needed such as having small talks before class, motivating students when trying new things, and offering incentives for my younger students. My approach ensured everyone felt cared for and motivated, reinforcing the idea that we grow best when we grow together. I see these same values reflected in ABA’s culture and commitment to #ABALOVE. I am eager to bring my experience and passion for supporting others to ABA, where I know I can contribute to a positive, inclusive environment that lifts everyone up, both personally and professionally.",NPO,Strategy,Marketing,https://drive.google.com/open?id=1Sbmh62J3cWlf4moKxkYxGnWo9ps9FvMk,"Instagram, Classroom Announcement, Handbill/Flyer, Friend, Calapalooza",Asian (including Indian subcontinent and Philippines origin),"One night me and my friends decided during dinner to try a case on YouTube!

No extracurricular commitments now.","I’m interested in ABA because of the potential to learn and grow in business, and as a human.
Firstly, I’d grow my business skillset and repietoire. As a finance consultant, I’d be learning fundamental skills I’ll need in my future job through the ABA teaching sessions. I’d also learn how to work with a team on financial topics and cases, which I cannot do in huge finance classes. I’m inspired by the projects ABA has done, such as consulting for Uniqlo, Venmo, and Adobe as of recent. I recognize that ABA works with clients that are relevant to the culture and society we live in. Being a finance consultant for ABA on important cases makes the transition into a geographically far-away finance internship less daunting for me.
I’m also interested in ABA for the people offered in the community. Through some highlight reels and reading very-fun fun facts, I can tell ABA is a place of comfort and a good time. Simply put, I’d love to join a tight-knit community of diverse interests and backgrounds.","The value I most resonate with is “Take Care of Each Other”. I connected with the blurb a lot. Coming from a less intense high school in the suburbs of Minnesota to Berkeley was challenging. Some less people truly knew me, and the competition of Berkeley added to the hard adjustment. I felt how important it was for people nearby to be taking care of you through the walks of life instantaneously. I am fortunate now to have made quality friends at Berkeley that I know care about me. An experience of mine that demonstrates this value was my friend Ashtma's troubles. After a beach day, my friend said it was hard to breathe and she needed urgent care. I was able to rent a car and bring her to an emergency room quite far away and I waited. Although weird to add in an essay, I think it demonstrates that above everything I put the people I care about first.

One of the primary things I hope to gain from ABA is a vibrant community of like-minded, ambitious, and driven peers who share my passion for finance and business. I’m eager to tap into the invaluable mentorship and extensive educational curriculum of technical knowledge and professional development offered by ABA to its members to prepare myself for a future career in finance and business. I also look forward to having access to ABA’s vast network of accomplished alumni as an vital resource I'm keen to leverage in my professional growth and development. 

Additionally, I see ABA not only as an opportunity to develop professionally and build professional relationships but also join a close-knit group of friends who support each other and have fun, creating lasting memories together. I also appreciate how ABA gives members the opportunity to gain real world experience by consulting and working with household name brands, with its extensive network of clients and corporate partners. I believe ABA would be a great fit for me as I think it is a perfect blend of both professional and fun atmospheres where goals are accomplished but members are still part of a tight knit community where fun happens and memories are made, which exactly matches what I am seeking.","I believe ABA's core value of learning and giving back to others is the one that best describes and aligns with my character. I think that it is extremely important to remain grateful for the opportunities and support that allowed you rise to the heights where you are today and honor that by giving back your time and expertise to the next generation, whose shoes you were once in. I feel that my past experiences in creative writing best exemplify this core value, which has alway been an hobby of mine as I am passionate about creating and exploring new worlds through fiction. 

One of the past experiences that best reflect this value was my position as Editor-in-Chief of my high school's writing club, where I was able to mentor younger members on their writing by helping edit their pieces and providing developmental feedback as well as teaching both the fundamentals as well as more complex writing techniques. By workshopping each club member's pieces one-on-one and helping them understand the writing process from beginning to end, they were able to developing their confidence as they found their unique writing styles and niches. Throughout the years, I have developed my own skills through individual practice and research and learning from the works of renowned authors, resulting in the publication of my own works and multiple wins in national writing contests, including a National Gold Medal in the Scholastic Art & Writing Awards. 

Outside of just the members of my high school’s writing club, I have also mentored students from local middle schools. I shared my work as examples to the students and helped many develop an interest in and find passion in creative writing, as many of them had creative minds and ideas but didn’t know how to express them through writing.",Finance,Business Development,NPO,https://drive.google.com/open?id=1rRbf_mvM9RHe3RQQkbiD9e8IhLhO3xnb,Calapalooza,Asian (including Indian subcontinent and Philippines origin),,15,15.0

I initially did not plan on applying to ABA, until Anh Thu approached me at Calapalooza and explained to me the committee structure of the club and its strong community. It pushed me to learn more at the Intro to Business event where I was able to learn more about the client projects from Ellie, and talk to all the officers at info sessions and workshops. ABA felt different from the endless consulting clubs around campus, as the down to earth and infectious energy made me more and more eager to want to become a part of this community. 
As a consulting club, both professionalism and the social aspect are integral to the actions of the club. I strongly believe getting to know your coworkers is what creates synergy between members, and ABA is the perfect place for that. These experiences would allow me to build my public speaking skills, collaboration with diverse clients, and most importantly, develop well rounded problem solving skills by learning from different perspectives. I look forward to forming lifelong connections with members who truly care for each other, and create a second family. I hope that through this organization, I am able to grow by surrounding myself with people who will push me to be a better version of myself.","ABA’s core value of #JustSeriousEnough best describes my desire to maintain a strong work life and social life balance. At the end of the day, the work you do is so that you can enjoy your free time as much as possible, and ABA’s fun environment embodies that value. I experienced a similar environment in my time at FBLA. Having been a four year member of FBLA and eventually becoming president, the club felt like my second home. I spent hours each week doing work with my members, and created some of my fondest core memories at my time there. Many of my officers loved to have hangouts and socialize together, and it was my duty to keep them in line so that they could do their job first. I made sure to keep them on track of first accomplishing their goals, after which they could let loose all they wanted to. Our meetings were constantly filled with laughter and jokes, but it also allowed us to be creative and come up with unique ideas that tested the norms of a typical high school club. It allowed us to collaborate freely and trust in one another when carrying out tasks, because we had formed strong bonds by constantly being around each other. I believe that my experience in FBLA has taught me the value of being just serious enough to create an approachable environment while maintaining my dedication, responsibility, and flexibility, which I hope to carry into ABA.

ABA's mission to cultivate well-rounded individuals who prioritize humility, integrity, and passion aligns with my personal values. The emphasis on hands-on professional experience through industry-focused projects is particularly appealing, as it provides a practical foundation for the theoretical knowledge gained in academic settings.

The values upheld by ABA all resonate with me deeply. These principles not only contribute to personal growth but also foster a supportive and collaborative environment within the organization. I am excited about the prospect of being part of a community that values humility, ambition, and tenacity – qualities that I believe are essential for personal and professional development.

What sets ABA apart for me is not only its commitment to professional growth but also its dedication to creating a strong sense of community, building friendships, and a genuine family-like atmosphere. I appreciate the belief that learning about business can coexist with having a fun and fulfilling social experience.

In joining ABA, I hope to gain not only valuable business insights and practical experience but also to become part of a close-knit community where I can forge lasting connections. I am eager to contribute my skills and learn from the diverse talents within the team. ABA's holistic approach to professional and personal development makes it an ideal platform for me to thrive and make a meaningful impact.","The core value of ABA that resonates most with me is ""Learn and Give Back."" This principle of continuously learning, applying it, and sharing it with others has shaped both my personal and professional growth. I firmly believe that learning is a lifelong process and that everyone has something to teach, and we all have the potential to learn. Giving back, for me, is not just about supporting the communities that have nurtured me; it's about actively contributing to their growth and well-being in return.

In high school, I embodied this value through my role as President of the Feeding Hong Kong Club, where I led initiatives that addressed food insecurity. We organized weekly food drives and bread runs, ensuring that elderly and underprivileged individuals received essential resources. By fostering a spirit of collaboration, I empowered others to join in and make a difference.

Since moving to Berkeley, my commitment to giving back has only deepened. Last semester, I decided to be a site leader for the Berkeley Project, helping organize and volunteer for local initiatives and strengthening my connection to a community that welcomed me as an international student.

Talking with Ryan and Daniel this past week allowed me to grasp the community that ABA fosters as they both raved about the relationships made through this club. Whether it is from the overnight retreats to the ragers to the party bus to even late-night study sessions, I am ready to find my family at ABA.

Additionally, the past projects that ABA has worked with like Colgate and BMW and the countless opportunities offered in the future will teach me how to polish my resume, case/market size, and interview for future internships which only excites me more to join ABA. ","The core value of ABA that best describes me is #GAIN&GIVE. 

As a kid who lacked confidence growing up, basketball was my way of developing as an individual. On the court, I learned leadership, social skills, and discipline. 

Realizing the influence of sports, I wanted to spread the power of basketball by assisting my local youth wheelchair basketball team. Although the assistant coaching job did come with its expected responsibilities like rebounding balls, refilling water bottles, and playing dummy defense, boosting team morale was an unexpected challenge. 

Turning to my passion in film, I started creating promotional videos for the team. Each steal and pass was compiled into a jam-packed reel, showcasing each player's unique talents paired with flashy visual effects. Eventually, I turned my attention towards creating a documentary to inspire a larger audience and to spread the power of sports that once helped me develop as a person. Ultimately, as I interviewed athletes, coaches, and parents, I combined my love for film-making with my desire to spotlight the challenges overcome by people with disabilities: showcasing the never-recognized heroism of every adaptive sports athlete. Internationally recognized, my video documentary on the Seattle Adaptive Sports team is now shown to inspire youth with disabilities as they learn to play sports for the first time in their lives. Solving challenges creatively while uplifting others and giving back to the community is my strength and I am excited to bring this energy and dedication to ABA.

In my prior experience interning at a Japanese NGO, I analyzed the financial statements of the World Bank’s climate adaptation strategies and gave recommendations on how the Japanese government could contribute in ways that would also support the development of the Japanese tech sector. I can still vividly remember presenting to the government officers about our research and seeing my work play a part in shaping larger decisions. 
Thus, I am particularly excited to learn more technical and business skills for applications to real-world problems and make a meaningful impact through ABA’s diverse consulting opportunities. I look forward to traveling the country or even the world to work with one of the biggest companies in their respective industries and make a contribution to the work that they contribute to this world.
I was also drawn to how consultants can jump around different teams every semester. As I still look to explore my career paths, I hope to see the various aspects of consulting and gain a holistic view of business-related industries.
Moreover, I felt ‘socially fit’ with ABA while attending the info sessions and having coffee chats with Paul. I wanted to belong to the community of like-minded students and build lifelong relationships with the people at ABA.","Humble, ambitious, and tenacious. These three words hold huge meanings for me and remind me of the experiences that I’ve been through. In high school, I had limited choices of courses available, and being a curiosity-driven person, I always wanted to learn more. I always thought that there was more to this world than I could ever know. In my research, I cold-emailed tens of professors at local universities for mentorship and a chance to crash into one of their classes. Most of them never even replied but through perseverance, I secured an opportunity to visit a professor’s seminar at a local university and receive mentorship on my research. 
ABA’s core value ‘Be humble, Be ambitious, Be tenacious’ resonates with me the most because I believe that true growth comes from seeking opportunities, listening, and learning from others. By staying humble, I can continue to push myself forward while keeping an open mind to new opportunities and insights. By being ambitious, I challenge myself to set high goals and push beyond my comfort zone to achieve them, knowing that ambition fuels both personal and professional growth. By being tenacious, I remain persistent in the face of obstacles, understanding that success often comes from resilience and determination over time. I hope that by becoming a part of ABA, I can further develop these qualities while contributing to the community, learning from others, and tackling diverse challenges with passion and perseverance.",Strategy,Finance,Business Development,https://drive.google.com/open?id=1ASdr2xbdkPLMgHjHNs7126UqDsI6KVDI,"Instagram, Handbill/Flyer, Calapalooza",Asian (including Indian subcontinent and Philippines origin),,14,14.0

Just as the core values entail, you must take care of your entire team in order to be successful. I believe this trait is overlooked by a lot of clubs on campus who seek individual success rather than team success. Consulting is one of the many professions that requires teamwork over individualism, which is truly visible through the clubs core values. In addition, I truly appreciate how ABA integrates multiple project teams, incorporating all aspects of business. As a typical college sophomore who hasn't truly decide upon his career yet, this flexibility to test out different professions through consulting is extremely appealing. Furthermore, the ability to have knowledge about multiple professions allows you to stand out against competition in the future.
In the team experience, I hope to continuously learn from my team members, hearing out their thoughts and opinions on any subject. In this way, I would be able to adjust my perspective on specific issues and learn from errors or mistakes in my own approach. In addition, the ability to have team experiences now can help me learn to approach projects differently in my future career. Lastly, I hope to gain life-long friends through the team experience at ABA. Having the ability to meet likeminded people on such a huge campus is a privilege and I will definitely take advantage of the opportunity. ","The ABA core value that best describes me is the idea of learning and giving back. Being the son of a first generation immigrant, I've been lucky enough to learn about different cultures and how they shape you as a human being. Without my mother teaching me about her experiences outside of the United States, I do not think I would the same human today. I see myself as more worldly and accepting knowing that everyone has different experiences and standards of living. This same sentiment is something I have tried to past down to my younger brother. By doing so, I believe I have opened up an entirely new world for my brother, making him appreciate what he has been given while always striving for greatness. The transition my mother had to make in order to move to the United States was difficult and something I've truly grown to recognize as time is gone on. The friendly welcome she received when arriving in the United States is something that I desire to give to all immigrants. Moving away from home is extremely challenging and without the acceptance of your new community, you may feel like an outsider. This is why learning and giving back is so important for me as it's essentially to learn about other peoples' experiences and change your approach.",Finance,Business Development,Marketing,https://drive.google.com/open?id=1ZUdCCKwjibAT3okMvAVyHKD6OEmDLBga,Website,White,,14,14.0

Currently, I am exploring potential career paths in product management, data analytics, and business analytics— fields in which some ABA members have thrived. I see ABA as my ""foot in the door"" to gaining hands-on experience, learning, and working alongside intelligent peers with similar career paths. I am particularly excited to connect with many expert alumni and those who hold positions in business analytics and product management. 

I am very interested in joining the Business Development team where I can work with others to deliver strategic, product-oriented solutions, and the Marketing team, where I can work with reputable brands to provide unique recommendations for product feature design and create innovative marketing campaigns. I believe both teams have areas of interest that match my aspirations of becoming a leader who creates impactful solutions and a driver that boosts business growth. 

Through applying to ABA, I'm excited to step outside my comfort zone, learn from a passionate group of individuals, and be part of a dynamic, vibrant team committed to making a real impact. ","ABA's ""Learn and Give Back"" value resonates with me the most. Throughout my academic and professional journey, I've embraced the balance of learning and leadership, recognizing the importance and interdependence of both roles. 

As a GBO leader, I had the opportunity to guide new transfer students at UC Berkeley. Drawing from my own experiences as a transfer student, I remember the challenges I faced and was able to give back by guiding academic life, campus involvement, and mental health. Through being a GBO leader, I was also still in the position of the learner as I gained a better understanding of empathy, communication, and fostering an inclusive environment. 

Through my role as Vice Chair of the Public Relations Committee for my community college, I led initiatives that increased student engagement by 35%, while also learning the importance of strategic thinking, teamwork, and adaptability. These experiences have shaped my understanding of giving back to my community and showed me how impactful learning can be when exchanging knowledge and areas of strengths with others.

If accepted into ABA, I seek to continue my journey in learning from experienced peers and alumni and giving back by contributing to the amazing client projects planned for this semester. I look forward to the opportunity to grow, apply my skills, and make a meaningful difference in the ABA community.

","My first week as a freshman felt overwhelming as I navigated hundreds of clubs, nerve-racking course registration, and multiple friend groups. In a school where everyone always seemed to be working, I want to find a tight-knit community where I don't feel like I’m always in a rat race. I genuinely feel like ABA is that for me. After talking to a few of the officers during GBO and tabling, I resonated with their stories. Everyone was passionate about business, helping their fellow club members, and most importantly, having fun. I found many like-minded students who were ambitious and driven in their goals to help make an impact through business. I felt ABA's nurturing environment that wasn't present in a lot of other business clubs. 

I hope to gain three things from my team experience. Firstly, I want to become close friends with many of my colleagues to form a group of people who I can depend on and have fun with. Next, I hope to narrow my career interests. By working on multiple projects in different fields I want to learn what I enjoy doing. Finally, I want to make a direct impact on people through my projects. I hope to see my work turn into real-world results that can help people in some way.

Overall, I know that ABA is the perfect club for me. I would get to explore my professional interests, create lifelong friends, and create real change using the skills that I've learned in the classroom.","Just serious enough. This statement accurately summarizes my entire academic life. Whether I am tracking asteroids or researching the US's trade policies, I never forget to have fun. This motto is something I aim to carry through everything that I do. A few summers ago I had attended the Summer Science Program, a prestigious astrophysics camp that was touted to be one of the most challenging high school science camps. A few weeks in and I was having the time of my life. I would spend my nights on long Python problem sets and my evenings playing soccer and ping pong. I firmly believe that to do good work you must make time for fun. This mentality is what has allowed me to pursue so many passions of mine without ever fearing failure. In everything that I do, my priority is to enjoy it and have fun. This naturally allows me to push myself and perform the best that I can. It's why I am currently exploring many different majors: from data science to biology to economics, I want to study something that I will enjoy, not what my parents would want. 

In a school like Berkeley where work seems to dominate everything, I hope to be a breathe of fresh air.  This doesn't mean I ever compromise on work, rather I believe that balance is key to bring the best out of myself. Whether I'm working on an ABA project or studying for my 61A final, I hope to always allow for fun in my life.",Strategy,NPO,Finance,https://drive.google.com/open?id=1yAiFteiY1__H4_RHL0TyrhsLEu9sXTA2,Current ABA member,Asian (including Indian subcontinent and Philippines origin),,14,13.0

Through my early-morning haze of integrals and parametrics, I just barely registered the flyer waving in my face before I was pulled from the crowd towards the ABA booth. Within a few minutes, members had managed to pull me from my calculus-induced daze into an animated conversation in front of Sather Gate. This spontaneous connection sparked my curiosity about both consulting and the unique culture of ABA.

Exploring my curiosity further, I attended the case workshop, where despite the boiling temperature of the room (I was sweating so much), the conversations I had with members were genuine and intriguing. I was able to learn about this semester’s ADP, Meta, and WWF projects, the lineage system, frameworks for casing, and the infamous party bus to Napa, while also experiencing the club’s lively and enthusiastic energy.

From ABA, I hope to gain a place where I can work, play, study, and party with a life-long community, to create formative experiences that will benefit me for years to come. For me, a successful college experience involves not only developing academically and professionally, but doing so with a genuine community. While many clubs could offer me the former, I believe the connection I feel with ABA can uniquely fulfill the latter.
","#INIT2GETHER

When I first joined Red Cross as a freshman, it had been my school’s most prominent service club. However, after the founding president graduated, it had deteriorated almost completely by my junior year.

Still, despite the dying culture, the club’s foundational mission of giving back to the community that had attracted me in the first place still resonated with me. Rather than watching the club continue its downward spiral, I made it my goal to bring it back to life, and applied for a leadership position.

By second semester, I was president of the club. My primary objective was to rebuild; rebuild membership, rebuild reputation, and rebuild the club's mission. The first event under my presidency had to be transformative, not just in impact, but in reshaping Red Cross as a reputable club.

Just around the time, the American Red Cross declared a national blood shortage. My choice of events was clear: a blood drive, Mason High School's first ever. I rallied my ten members, organizing them into productive committees, setting weekly check-ins, and persistently emailing with the American Red Cross and district administration. After our countless hours of preparation, we successfully collected 44 units of blood, a feat that translated into saving 132 lives. 

With the blood drive, Red Cross experienced a renaissance. Word of our success spread around the school, causing membership to surge from 10 to over 70. Our meetings became meaningful and packed, ranging from delicious potlucks to team community service trips. From rebuilding Red Cross, I have learned that leadership is more than merely sustaining momentum, it is the ability to create success with your team from rock-bottom.

I became a master of time management and planning, always ready with a new game or activity to keep their attention. Leading those classes transformed me, making me more organized, responsible, and quick on my feet. It showed me that leadership is about staying calm, being creative, and turning challenges into fun experiences.

","From getting cut from the competitive HS debate team my sophomore year, to becoming ranked 13th in Northern California for Lincoln-Doulgas debate, it was my friends that allowed me to flourish by giving me an open opportunity to learn. In the summer after I as cut, my friends coached my weaknesses, which enabled me to tryout and regain my spot on the team. It was their teachings and confidence in me, that made me believe and flourish as the debater I am today.

My friends’ offer of giving me a learning opportunity, with no clause of giving something back, is why I started Simple Tutor, a non-profit organization focused on debate tutoring. I wanted to create a curriculum and activities, to help those who could not help themselves. By our second year, we expanded to 1,052 students across 4 U.S. states and 2 states in India, accelerating their learning beyond the limitations of traditional debate camps.

Through my debate journey, and in every aspect of my life, I hope to give someone the open chance to better themselves. The ABA value of learning and giving back is what I’ve been following, and hope to continue as I join and grow within new organizations of business and technology.

Each city brought a new crowd, a new culture, and most importantly, new opportunities. Moving seemed fun until each change became a test of my versatility. I did not feel “Indian” enough in Delhi, definitely not “British” enough in London, and not adept enough to survive the hustle of New York. Throughout my life, I had to embrace adaptability to find welcoming communities. 

My desire to join ABA stems from the tight knit community that promotes growth beyond consulting. Having lacked it in the past, working alongside projects in a close family setting ignites genuine passion for development, something that I value coming to a brand new coast of America. 

I know that I can get closer to becoming a global changemaker through ABA. Working with all backgrounds of people as well as across the five project teams allows me to leave local bubbles, bringing about large scale business impacts that can lead societies to developmental equality. My home state, I quickly learned Alabama’s attitude towards economic production was far different from any other place I had lived, showing me that understanding innovation differences completes the puzzle to map out global change. I’m confident the collaboration and close-knit bonding ABA provides will help me illustrate my picture of universal transformation. 

At ABA, I hope to gain more than a team of good consultants, but rather, a strong group of friends that after the blend of professional and social work, turn into my close family.
","“What are we doing today?” 

As I walked into the Economics Club, lively discussions echoed around the room. I had a presentation ready to deliver, but quickly, I put it aside and let them continue. It was the first year of the club, but the way we talked, we could have been on Wall Street. 

Bright minds in a dim environment, I knew I just needed the platform. 

Watching the faces of my club members light up while trading, I found my calling in lifting my city. As such, I created Sophisticated Finance Society, designed to teach financial literacy around Birmingham. I was learning everything for the first time myself but I knew I had to give back. 

I shook a lot of hands, from economics professors to business leaders, but quite frankly, most of what they said went in one ear and out the other. However, one thing caught my attention: a bill for high school financial literacy.

Giving back after learning is key for bringing up underrepresented societies. Absent resources in Alabama, I knew I had to step up and give back to a community lacking strong mentorship. Truly, that success excited me the most; seeing smiles and passion across my city. 

Not long after, I sent out emails to Alabama’s state representatives asking how I could get involved. As I modified the curriculum, a smile spanned across my face. I changed my state forever.

The better question to ask, I thought— “What can we do today?”.

My takeaway from meeting everyone is that ABA is a great fit for me because the group’s success is not just because of the great program, but also because of the tight-knit members who share similar passions/values/goals while having fun doing it. 

This appeals to me because while I took some business courses in high school and have some experience in various business fields, I want to be able to learn in an environment that focuses on success through teamwork and taking care of one another. After all, we’ll be spending countless hours together, and I truly believe that to reach my full potential I have to be surrounded by people who care about me just as much as I care about them. 

While I know my business acumen and knowledge of various fields of business will expand throughout this team experience, I think that the true value of ABA to me will be learning, sharing, and growing together with the friends and connections that I will make through ABA and into the future. I have made a lot of friends after my first week on campus, but it was not until attending the first info session with ABA, that it felt like home. The connection I felt when meeting ABA members that have genuine shared interests both personally and professionally was incredible and has me excited for what the future might hold as a member of ABA.","I believe the core value that describes me the most is “Learn and Give Back.” Throughout the ten years I’ve been playing baseball, I was mentored by some of the most genuinely caring coaches in San Francisco and they helped shape me into the person I am today. While my coaches might think their greatest gift to me was choosing me to pitch in the SF Championship Game at Oracle Park, the core values of teamwork, family, and caring for each other that they instilled in me far outweigh any individual award or experience. 

As I got older and started to appreciate the magnitude of my coach's selfless commitment to us, I started to give back to the next generation by volunteering at the rec league team in middle school, coaching my younger brother's team, and even taking a couple of freshmen under my wing during my senior year of high school. In order to share the baseball IQ and passion I have for the game, I took kids to the local field, created individualized training plans, and mentored future captains.  

Additionally, I still actively mentor my younger brother and his friends, giving them academic advice and sharing my experiences. Looking forward, I hope to continue giving back not only to future members of ABA but also to speak to high school kids about what clubs like ABA at Cal have to offer.

Like many others, I was intrigued by the consulting clubs, attending various infosessions, including ABA’s, though I wasn’t truly invested in consulting at the time. I applied to a few clubs, made some interviews, but was ultimately rejected. At that stage, I was more focused on enjoying my freshman year and didn’t pursue it seriously.

By my second semester, I thought I should try again. I attended ABA’s infosession once more, without realizing I’d already been to one. This time, I had coffee chats with Tashi and Andreas, who were incredibly welcoming, and I felt a great vibe from everyone I met. However, I was dealing with a family emergency and couldn’t apply that semester.

Now, I’m more focused on professional development, and ABA was the first consulting club that came to mind. Coffee chats with Erin and Elaina reaffirmed the supportive community. I’m excited to work on impactful projects like the one with WWF this semester and grow in ABA’s collaborative, relaxed environment. I’m confident I’ll gain the skills and guidance I need to figure out my future career path without feeling overwhelmed.

I also look forward to building close friendships with like-minded peers. ABA’s core values of teamwork resonate deeply with me, and I’m excited to join a community where collective growth is at the forefront.","Among ABA’s five core values, “Success Through Collaboration” (#INIT2GETHER) resonates with me the most. Throughout my academic and professional journey, I’ve experienced firsthand the power of teamwork and collective effort in achieving shared goals. As Marketing Director for the American Cancer Society at Berkeley, I led a team to raise awareness and support for cancer research. This role taught me that success is not an individual pursuit but a collective endeavor. Leading initiatives alongside diverse peers helped me develop my leadership skills while ensuring that each team member’s strengths were fully utilized.
Additionally, founding The Miracle Fund in Singapore and Indonesia highlighted the importance of working with others to achieve meaningful outcomes. By collaborating with volunteers, donors, and community leaders, I was able to provide medical supplies to underprivileged communities, proving that true success stems from a unified effort.
I’m confident that ABA’s collaborative environment will help me grow both personally and professionally. I’m eager to contribute my experience in teamwork and leadership to ABA’s diverse projects, while also learning from the unique perspectives of my peers.

UCB Zahanat - Bollywood Fusion Dance Team","	Stepping foot onto Berkeley's campus my freshman year, I was searching for 2 things in college. Making as many quality friendships and learning as much as possible. Applying for clubs to meet these expectations, I've noticed that ABA's tight-knit community and intellectual diversity are what catch my eye.
	Firstly, the social aspect of ABA interests me, not just because of my friends Adil and Sharan's positive words about the club, but also how each ABA member had their own unique favorite memory on the website. Reading these experiences made me feel excitement when starting this application. I'm confident events, from with the full team like retreat to smaller socials like poker, will forge life-long friendships.
	Beyond the socializing, I've researched the professional development resources I plan to utilize. The range of services ABA offers to clients intrigues me, as I'm still discovering what fields I plan to pursue. Areas like strategy would fulfill my inner desire to have my changes heard for an actual business, whereas the finance team quenches the inner The Wolf of Wall Street in me. As I still discover my plans for the future, I'm glad ABA offers a variety of niches to choose from.
	 Reminding myself my college plans are socializing, networking, and learning, I know I'd be even more honored to stay up at 2 a.m. at my project manager’s apartment decking for a deliverable, then spending the next day at 2 a.m. ordering a Vodka Sicilian Pizza at Artichoke's after an ABA social.
","        The ABA core value that describes me well, and I would like to write about is ""Just Serious Enough."" While other values like taking care of each other or being ambitious may be more impactful, I try to live by the fifth core value of #JSE.
        I've applied #JSE in my life recently in a multitude of ways. On a more deep and personal level, I believe life is too short to be very serious and hold grudges or get angry at people; hence, #JSE is present in my life, ensuring I stay level-headed and lax in every situation. On the surface level, I've applied being just serious enough in the activities I engage in, such as dance (UCB Zahanat) or other hobbies like poker. Whether I'm striking conversation with other dance teams, even though we're competing against each other at the tournaments, or I lose $20 in poker after calling a shove because ""it's just poker,"" I've noticed the many areas #JSE has contributed to my life.
        In a professional setting like a consulting club, I envision myself completing my tasks and, hopefully, accomplishing the goals we set out at the start of the year. However, the journey there is what counts, and I'll do my best to make sure my project team's journey is filled with laughter, smiles, and a little bit of ""let's lock in.""",Business Development,Strategy,Finance,https://drive.google.com/open?id=1ZCpLWiqhv8qByv3QWd7Qoj7ujo-PTKuY,"Handbill/Flyer, Friend",Asian (including Indian subcontinent and Philippines origin),,14,14.0

At ABA, I will be surrounded by a group of talented and driven people who emphasize giving back to their respective communities and each other. The phrase “to be professional, but not buttoned-up” resonates with the type of club environment that I am looking for and I truly believe that ABA will be where I can find my community at Cal. 

ABA’s projects possess incredible range and quality. As an incoming freshman and little specialized knowledge, this will grant me the opportunity to gain insight into a variety of fields and discover the places where I am willing to invest my time and gear my future career. Being a part of ABA will challenge me professionally and develop me as a person and global citizen. At ABA, I hope to find professional opportunities but beyond that, I will make meaningful bonds and lifelong friendships. From talking to ABA members on Sproul Plaza, I truly realized that this club is a place where I can truly thrive and feel fully supported through my growth as a consultant and a friend and person through my years as an undergraduate student. ","“Be humble, be ambitious, and be tenacious” encapsulates where my goals in college and how I want to extend my involvement from my high school experience. 

To me, this tricolon means speaking up and considering perspectives that otherwise would be silenced: as an officer of my high school’s campus newspaper, I broke groupthink and raised the prospect of addressing taboo issues like paid tutoring and cheating controversies. My high school’s host country China had an ongoing history of repressing public speech and the press, and against this backdrop, I took the initiative to launch a podcast episode that used interviews and investigative research to raise awareness of taboo topics like the sale of leaked passages on online Chinese marketplaces. 

Since the podcast’s inception, members of the newspaper and I have been encouraged by its positive reception to continue discussing the sensitive issues that matter most to our audience. To me, our act of defiance against a culture of taboo embodies what it means to be ambitious, tenacious, yet humble. 

From soccer teams to club leadership teams and group project teams, I can elevate any team. As a goalkeeper, I do the dirty work and direct my defense to anticipate weaknesses in our back line. In my student government committee, I worked extra hours alongside four other brilliant officers to instate club participation quotas and an election oversight mechanism. My past experiences completely align with this value and I am so glad to have found an organization like ABA with such highly-aligned aims.

I think that the community ABA fosters not only allows its members to explore various industries, but also allows insight into how top companies work to operate and problem-solve. After hearing my friend’s experience in ABA, I became interested in the club’s passion for both its work and making the most of their time together. The community seems driven but also passionate in uplifting and encouraging each other to chase their goals. Many of the club members also pointed out ABA’s flexibility, which allows its members to explore and develop skills across different fields each semester. Through my team experience, I hope to gain a close-knit community that motivates me to raise my goals and express appreciation for collaborating success. Additionally, I hope to gain life-long skills that will not only help grow my professional career, but also learn to be eager for knowledge and to give back to my own members in the future. 
","Out of ABA’s five core values, I believe #INIT2GETHER describes me the best. Collaboration plays a large part in succeeding as a leader. My experiences have taught me about the importance of listening and valuing the opinions of others, even when they do not completely align with my own perspective. When I first started my tutoring business in high school, I had to curate my own curriculum to train other student tutors and develop a team that would work with kids in reading development. By listening to my team’s feedback and holding monthly meetings, I was able to gain insight on their perspectives and creative ideas that helped my business improve. In projects, such as my skin cancer awareness workshops, I learned to take in feedback from the guest speakers and incorporate their ideas in the workshops I hosted. What aided my success the most was when I chose to genuinely appreciate the feedback and opinions of my fellow peers or teams. While I was able to gain experience in organizing and guiding others, I also value collaboration and the encouragement teammates give each other to help succeed their goals.

The support goes beyond current members–alumni stay involved, and I find that level of commitment so unique and valuable. In terms of my path, I see myself beginning with strategy consulting. I want the opportunity to learn how to solve complex business problems and learn how companies can position themselves for the future. Something unique to ABA is their Analyst Development Program which will help me to develop the skills necessary for me to explore the field of business. With the five different teams, I am excited to explore and find what particularly fits me which I feel ABA will be very supportive of. The strategic thinking I’ll develop in consulting will give me a strong foundation for understanding potentially the financial side of business whether it’s analyzing investments or shaping financial strategies. The idea of getting hands-on experience in various fields, while being supported by such a close-knit community excites me. Knowing that alumni and current members are there to mentor and guide me along the way makes ABA feel more like a long-term investment in both my career and personal growth. It’s this combination of professional development and strong relationships that makes me want to be a part of it. ","     Of ABA’s five core values, “Success Through Collaboration” (#InIt2gether) describes me best. My past experiences have shown that real success doesn’t happen in isolation–it happens when people come together to share ideas and push each other to excel. I’ve found myself to particularly thrive in environments where collaboration drives innovation. For example, as co-captain of my Moot Court team, I led a team of peers in crafting compelling legal arguments. While I was leading, our success came from working together analyzing cases as a group, and learning from each other’s perspectives. We always functioned as a unit. This resonates with ABA’s philosophy that even though leadership might feel unnatural at first, everyone must own their part of the project. My research role at Caltech’s SHArK Lab further solidified this collaborative mindset. While conducting experiments on sustainable energy, I worked with postgrads and fellow researchers, all contributing different skill sets to achieve a shared goal. We pooled our knowledge together but also stepped up to lead different parts of the project. As captain of my high school basketball team, teamwork is my forte; I know when to take charge, but I also know when to pass the ball to someone else. To me, collaboration isn’t just about working with others; it’s about knowing when to lead when to listen, and when to pass the ball. ABA’s value of success through collaboration reflects my belief that the best outcomes come from collective effort, and I’m excited to bring that mindset to the team.

Time commitments: My only time commitment is my role in ALAPIO (2-3 hours a week)","While exploring the multiple clubs Berkeley had to offer, I was drawn into ABA during tabling. I learned about the structure of the club, and upon attending the info sessions, I was drawn into the clients this club has worked with in the past and the clients for this semester. I’m also drawn into the alumni network for this club, with it being one of the oldest consulting clubs in berkeley. Not only that, but watching the fall recruitment video during info session made me see why one of the core values is #jse. It seems as if this club has a perfect social life and work life balance, and that it has a community that I would like to be a part of. During the case workshop when put into smaller groups, I noticed that the current members made sure that everyone understood casing, and took their time explaining topics if we didn’t understand it, which is something that I really liked about this club as well. I hope to gain certain skills from my team experience, such as skills in market segmentation and brand strategy if I was placed on the marketing team. As for other teams, I hope to gain cost/benefit analysis, risk management, and strategy analysis. I also hope to refine my teamwork and problem-solving skills, and gain valuable experience that I can use for the future.","The first ABA core value that best describes me is #init2gether.  Throughout both my academic and extracurricular journey, I’ve noticed that the best and most successful experiences are during those where I would work closely with others to achieve a common goal. The best example for this would be my time as a Lead website developer for ACS Youth Ambassadors. Our team had the common goal of raising awareness for cancer in a more efficient and accessible way, and with this in mind we collaborated together to successfully create a website. Not only did I learn how to use the strengths of each of my team members efficiently, but I also learned that our success was never about individual recognition, but rather the collective impact we made as a group.
Another ABA core value that describes me is #gainandgive. My mother always told me “the most rewarding feeling in life is taking what you learned and being able to pass it forward.” One of the ways this has been most evident is when I tutored at Agoura Math Circle. I first started off as a student, learning advanced topics back in middle school. I was always grateful for this program, as it single handedly saved my math grade, allowing me to receive an A. That’s when I wanted to share what I learned to the next generation, hence I signed up to be a Tutor, teaching the same knowledge that I gained and passing it forward.

In a club with such a variety of interests and diverse members, I am excited to contribute not only to its diversity drive with my novel perspective but also technically with my skills in Python, Javascript, and Adobe software. I also bring experience in managing finances, social media, and external relations for multiple NGOs and projects, including the ""New Opportunities Project,"" a partnership I co-founded in which university students mentored local business owners in accounting and finance, leading to a 30% increase in net profits within 5 weeks. Thus, with a growth-oriented mindset that encourages me to both cherish the opportunities I am given and actively seek out new ones, I plan to expand ABA's consulting reach to Brazilian and Latin American industries.
Nevertheless, what excites me most about ABA is the chance to explore my future options and passions within such a welcoming, close community. I resonate deeply with the club's value of fostering a true sense of family, as I believe that camaraderie and support enable me to be the most effective and authentic version of myself. At ABA, I aim to refine my strengths, acquire new intangible skills, and collaborate with like-minded, ambitious individuals, consulting for socially aware organizations. This experience will broaden my horizons, clarify my ideal career path, and bring forth a sense of fulfillment from being part of a supportive and goal-oriented business circle.","Learn and give back:
Growing up split between two realities always enacted a pang of moral guilt in me. On weekdays, I delve into my bilingual school's privileged environment; on weekends, I get back to what I always considered to be my community: my family's poverty-stricken rural town, Abreu e Lima. At 14 years old, I realized that I could alleviate my community's struggles by teaching English to teenagers—the same language that allowed me to study abroad and experience different cultures. In a few months, that idea gave birth to the social project “English Transform"": an NGO that aimed at teaching children aged 12-17 from at-risk communities how to speak English for free. 
	Aside from teaching, one of my passions in life is storytelling. I see art as the quintessential form of transmitting knowledge to others. Thus, I find myself motivated to learn as much as I can, hoping to develop a strong repertoire from where I can draw inspiration to galvanize others’ learning processes.In fact, to become qualified and keep my passion vivid, I took screenwriting courses at MSU and developed a portfolio of nine short stories and two long-form narratives—something I hope will serve as a starting point for effectively sharing some of the knowledge I am so grateful to have receive.

As a second year, my general interest have been established, but not my specific focus. One of my interest however in consulting in which I believe ABA would provide the best experience. In the summer I was able to acquire a consulting internship but pieces were missing. It wasn't until chatting with ABA members at the tabling event which was when I realized I was lacking professionalism and support. From my perspective, consulting projects can be done with anyone but brainstorming with the people I love is more important.

Personally, My experience with children began in 2017 when I co-founded the student organization within ELC (a non-profit organization). We provided after-school tutoring services for those in need. Although it began as an educational service, I soon quickly became invested in the cognitive and psychological aspects of the students that I teach after completing AP psychology at my high school. Many actions puzzle me as some student would just lash out for no reason while others make unique decisions when faced with creative assignments. In addition, I got to witness the stages of cognitive development near my sister's three children. As they increase in age, I have to experiment with different ways to appeal to their interest at their current stages. I finally realized my love for children and my curiosity for them after seven years of constant interaction.

VP of the Saudi Arabian Association at Berkeley","I am drawn to ABA because of its unique blend of professional development and community. The opportunity to work on hands-on consulting projects with Fortune 500 companies, while learning from experts in market research, case analysis, and financial literacy, aligns with my academic and professional interests in Operations Research and Marketing. I believe ABA will provide the perfect environment to apply my skills and knowledge in a real-world business context, helping me grow into a well-rounded business leader.

What excites me most is the emphasis ABA places on collaboration and community. I thrive in environments where teamwork is not only encouraged but celebrated. Through ABA, I hope to learn from diverse perspectives and work alongside like-minded peers, all while building long-lasting connections. The Analyst Development Program, in particular, is a great opportunity for me to hone technical skills like Excel and market research while contributing my own ideas to solve complex business challenges.

I’m excited to step out of my comfort zone, take on leadership roles within project teams, and develop skills that will help me succeed in both consulting and marketing. Ultimately, I hope to gain a strong sense of belonging and professional growth by being part of ABA's tight-knit community.","The core value that best describes me is ""Success Through Collaboration"" (#InIt2gether). As the Vice President of the Saudi Arabian Association at Berkeley, I was responsible for overseeing a team of five committee heads and organizing events that promoted cultural awareness and cross-cultural dialogue. This leadership role taught me that collaboration is essential to achieving meaningful outcomes. By working closely with each committee head and encouraging open communication, we were able to host over 10 events per year, increasing member engagement by 30% and fostering a stronger sense of community.

One of the key moments of collaboration in my role was when we planned a large-scale cultural event that required coordination across multiple teams, including marketing, logistics, and outreach. My role was to ensure that everyone was aligned on our goals, and that each team was empowered to contribute their ideas and skills. The success of the event was a direct result of the shared ownership we all felt, and it reminded me that great things happen when everyone works together toward a common goal.

I believe that collaboration leads to success in any setting, and I’m excited to bring this mindset to ABA.

But being able to hang out with other interns and coworkers, whether it be going on a hike or relaxing at someone’s house, was a revealing experience. I was part of a community that prioritized work at an enjoyable yet motivating level. Eager to be a part of a similar community at Berkeley, I started looking at different organizations to join. From talking to members during tabling to coffee chats and even close friends in the club, I quickly realized that ABA is the community I am looking for. ABA’s purpose of producing lasting professional projects while creating a social family-like environment appeals to me greatly.

Learning from team experience at ABA, I hope to hone in on skills that one can’t practice in the classroom, such as presenting to leadership and conducting company analysis. I look to gain exposure to the corporate world, taking on projects whose scope has meaningful and lasting outcomes. I wish to develop myself professionally; enhancing my resume and obtaining help for career opportunities. The extensive network of alumni who are still connected with ABA excites me. On top of all of this, though, I hope to gain life-long friendships who will be able to motivate and further me, and for whom I can do the same.","Five years ago, I joined my school’s track team. This was an environment where each runner’s success was a reflection of the strength of the group. On long runs, the distance runners would set the pace and ensure that every runner kept up. During sprints, our sprinters would tease us to catch them. Cracking jokes and telling stories, we did anything to take our minds off the brutal workouts. The rhythmic pounding of feet on gravel trails, the collective energy of a team bound by a shared goal; these are the feelings that will forever stay fresh in my mind. Looking back, I realized that we built a community rooted in trust, support, and a shared vision of crossing the finish line not as individuals, but as a team. This shared vision eventually brought us to becoming state champions. This experience taught me that the true power of any organization lies in its ability to unite diverse talents toward a common purpose, producing outcomes that far exceed what could be achieved alone. Thus, “Init2Gether“ is the core value that best describes me.

Looking to join ABA, I am drawn to the same sense of community and collaborative excellence. I am inspired to be part of a group where, much like my running team, the focus is not just on individual achievements but on delivering professional outputs that set new standards and rival the work of top firms. Just as I once crossed the finish line with fellow runners, I look forward to crossing new finish lines with ABA.",Finance,Strategy,Business Development,https://drive.google.com/open?id=1sWToKJRsuqB8_QMAPVCZOyc_Xbf5BFaE,"Members of Club: Minju, Yumin, Kyle",Asian (including Indian subcontinent and Philippines origin),,14,14.0

Extracurricular activities: archery (2hr/wk commitment)","The word ""consulting"" is broad, but ABA transforms the nuances of discovering consulting into a welcoming team, cohort, and community. I am particularly drawn to ABA because of its comprehensive variability of teachings through the five project teams. Joining the marketing project team specifically catches my eye. My experience as a lifestyle blogger and content creator have not only allowed me to build and develop my personal brand, but have also given me a robust understanding of the dynamics between business strategy and consumer engagement. I’m eager to maximize this experience to deepen my knowledge by working with large companies, agencies, and firms on engaging consulting projects that drive innovation and deliver meaningful results. Expanding into other sectors such as business development, finance, and NPO consulting equally excites me as I seek to broaden my understanding of how diverse industries operate.

As someone who is motivated and eager to make a meaningful impact, I am enthusiastic about the prospect of joining a team of intelligent and driven individuals who also value commitment, a strong work ethic, as well as community. Beyond the professional opportunities, I look forward to the prospect of forging meaningful connections with driven, like-minded peers through social activities and retreats. Joining the ABA family, building lasting friendships, and sharing great experiences with supportive and enthusiastic individuals is something I hope to experience this fall! 
","The ABA core value that best represents me is #GAIN&GIVE—the belief in learning, applying, and later giving back to your community. My experience at a military boarding school exemplifies this value, where leadership was a structured process of growth and responsibility. As a freshman and sophomore, I absorbed essential leadership skills from upperclassmen I looked up to, and by my junior and senior years, I was eager to apply those lessons in various leadership roles to guide others. I actively sought out diverse positions across campus to make a meaningful impact in multiple areas, as I wanted to support younger students navigate different fields and grow as individuals.

As the Hall Prefect of Atrium Dorm, I conducted daily room inspections, prepared in-depth cleanliness reports every Sunday, and handled evening announcements, ensuring that my dorm ran smoothly. More importantly, I served as a mentor and support system for new students, helping them adjust to dorm life and fostering a sense of community and responsibility among the residents. Additionally, as Academic Chair, I oversaw 10 Academic Prefects and operated the Peer Coaching Program, ensuring that new students received academic support in areas like organization, study skills, and motivation.

These roles gave me the opportunity to use the skills I had learned through the leadership system, give back to my community, and help my mentees grow. ABA’s emphasis on learning and giving back aligns with this approach, and I’m excited about the prospect of contributing to such an impactful community at Berkeley.

Throughout highschool, as I’ve navigated my way through jobs and internships, from environmental consulting to swim coaching, I gradually discovered just how much I enjoyed being in a fast-paced, collaborative environment, working alongside others towards a common goal. During my first week at Berkeley, ABA caught my eye because it offers that same dynamic – its sense of community, problem-solving nature, and #JSE (being Just Serious Enough). At info sessions and through coffee chats, ABA members also emphasized to me just how many new things I would get to learn through the club, and the support that would be offered to me if I were to join. I’m interested in ABA because I’d like to be able to grow and learn, while also finding a community at Berkeley. Through my team experience, I hope to gain technical skills, like decking, data analysis, and more, but beyond that, I see AbA as a potential home where I  could gain insights to what my future career could look like. Ultimately, ABA would enable me to gain consulting experience while also satisfying the part of me that loves working alongside my friends that share my goals, creating a place of support and love, while also making a lasting impact on the broader business world. ","	The ABA core value that best describes me would definitely be Learn and Give Back (#GainAndGive). Throughout my childhood, my parents often took me back to their homeland, India, to volunteer in underserved communities, ingraining in me the importance of using my resources for good. As I reached high school, I took this value with me, and used my experience as a volleyball player and swimmer to coach special needs kids in these sports. I continue to hold the children I coached close to my heart, because they taught far more about leadership and empathy than I could ever teach them. Moments with these children reinforced my belief that true growth happens when we pass down our skills to others. Aside from coaching, I also participated in an internship where I used data analysis to predict fire growth, used by NOAA to predict evacuation orders for fires in 2023, helping me give back to the community. I took the data analysis skills I learned and taught them to new interns as I left the company, knowing the importance the project held, and the need for the new generation to continue giving back. While both these experiences were part of companies with a much larger scope than just me, I have always believed it is my duty to teach others skills I have gained, so they can continue giving back, and eventually create a cycle. I hope that, if I get the opportunity to join ABA, I will be able to continue doing this and, one day, teach the new ABA family the skills I’ve gained.

I learned all about the projects, socials, and values and noticed that ABA was something I wanted to be a part of. I believe that ABA’s unique approach to having multiple different departments allows for me to explore all of my interests. From BD to NPO consulting, I was drawn to how diverse the skills at ABA were.

At ABA, I look forward to practicing my critical thinking and communication skills on a higher level. By working with professionals on real-life problems, I will be able to learn from members of the industry. Additionally, I look to learn from the leaders at ABA, and learn different thinking styles. I look forward to taking positive traits from other members of ABA and applying them to my own character. 

Outside of learning in the classroom, I seek to develop my leadership skills. As a leader in boy scouts, I have always led more physical and direct projects. However as I enter college, I want to expand my leadership skills and apply them to more technical projects. At ABA, I want to learn from the best in order to develop these skills so I could be prepared for my career after college.
","For the last 12 years of my life, I have been a part of a second family. From trudging on week-long backpacking trips in the depths of the wilderness to learning about the rich Vietnamese culture through songs and stories, Vietnamese Scouting has taught me vital outdoor skills while teaching me the intricacies of my culture. 

Although I moved to Cal for college, I still am active in my troop. I recently flew back down for our Labor Day Camp and participated as a Scout Master leading program for scouts and taught training drills. In the future, I plan to go back to my troop and rejoin my family by being a full-time scoutmaster. I could not imagine my life without joining my scouts as it showed me valuable life skills and taught me about my Vietnamese heritage.

At ABA, I will provide the same dedication and passion. I resonate the most with the learning and give back value, as it is important to create a full circle from student to teacher.

They took the time to explain how everything works, which was incredibly helpful, especially since I was an exchange student unfamiliar with the club processes. Unlike other clubs, I felt a genuine sense of comfort and belonging with ABA. Initially, I was a bit intimidated, having never done a case before. But the team did an amazing job breaking it down, which even sparked my interest in strategy as a potential career path. I want to give a special thanks to Ellie, Adil, and David—they helped me understand the club better and offered great advice on what to expect for the interview and what strategy as a career could look like.

As someone with long-term entrepreneurial goals, I believe ABA offers the perfect environment to build a strong network of driven, talented individuals. It’s also an opportunity to learn and grow in areas where I’m still developing, like strategy and marketing.

Since high school, I’ve consistently set aside time to contribute to teaching others, not only because I enjoy it, but because I believe in sharing knowledge with those around me. This is also what attracts me to your club, as I see how much effort is put into making information accessible to all interested students, regardless of whether they join the club or not.

My journey with teaching began in 7th grade when I started tutoring underprivileged students in my neighborhood in India, helping them with math and English. Later, in high school, I continued to take time each week to help my friends with subjects they found challenging or to lead revision sessions before exams. The most rewarding experience, however, came during my time at ESSEC Business School in France. As part of the student council, we realized that the accounting courses were particularly difficult for students from non-business or economics backgrounds. In response, I organized and taught three classes each week, each lasting 1.5 hours, to help 80 students understand the basics of accounting. After that in the summer of 2023 I volunteered as a teacher for underprivileged Greek children in Athens. This experience remains one of the highlights of my life.

Growing up in Lahaina, Hawaii, I learned the significance of Ohana (family), which deeply influenced my understanding of teamwork and support. This value has been a guiding principle in my personal and professional life.

In my role as a Property Manager, I managed guest communications and coordinated with FEMA to provide temporary housing for wildfire survivors. I learned the importance of collaboration, as working with various stakeholders and adapting our approach were crucial to successfully aiding displaced families. Similarly, at Lahaina Gelato, I collaborated closely with my team to navigate the challenges of the COVID-19 pandemic, which led to a remarkable 200%+ increase in sales. These experiences taught me that organization, collaboration, and mutual support are essential for achieving great results.

As a cognitive science major on the pre-med track, my path is somewhat unconventional compared to other pre-med students.

I want to learn research techniques, analytical thinking, and strategic planning to translate my ideas into tangible results for real-world clients and businesses.

We strived to make our next spreads better than the one before and pushed each other past our limits to allow each person the freedom to succeed in their respective roles. As a result, I believe “#Be, Be Humble, Be Ambitious, Be Tenacious” is the ABA core value that best describes me.
My strong commitment to #Be is how my yearbook team began to notice the enhanced focus and excitement in our yearbook community. Since the strength of our team lied in its collective knowledge and the ability to learn from one another, #Be was a fundamental part in creating an exceptional final yearbook product.

But as I've learned, everyone on your team has so many different skills, and only through successful task delegation and motivating your teammates can you truly succeed. Thus, as the Director of Advancement, I worked diligently, with a team with various backgrounds and skills, to improve PR efforts, but also passionately encourage my team members to keep pushing forward. Through our collaborative efforts, we were able to grow our team to over 15000 students and 1000 teachers from all over the globe. 

Thus, besides genuinely loving entrepreneurship and the thrill of starting new initiatives, I know how important it is to have a team that you can uplift and can uplift you.

However, as I’ve continued to branch out, conversations with industry veterans have opened my eyes to the complexities of “development,” where differing visions of the future and funding allocations create significant challenges. 

This change in understanding of what “real-life projects” entail sparked my interest in consulting, and ultimately led me to ABA. In the past year, I worked with Hilary at Blake Gardens where we both led volunteering initiatives as project leads. I was introduced to her work in non-profit organizations, and in many ways she acted like a mentor to me. Seeing her passions and motivations inspired me to take further initiatives towards my own.

As I continued to look into ABA I was intrigued by the culture of the students involved, as well as the content of the projects described to me. The environment within the club fosters a tight-knit community of professionals, characterized by collaboration and mutual support. The collaborative atmosphere not only enriches the professional experience, but also strengthens the success of the group. From this team involvement, I would hope to enhance my interpersonal skills and gain insight into utilizing group dynamics to improve project outcomes. Overall, ABA promises to be a transformative opportunity, equipping me with the tools and insights needed to work towards my passions. 
","ABA’s value to be humble, be ambitious and be tenacious, stood out to me as it highlighted one of my own core values. Growing up on the East Coast with immigrant parents that always guided my path to pursue what I was passionate about, I found myself so immersed and engrossed about design and the outdoors. This has led me to come to Cal for my undergrad in Sustainable Design and Environmental Economics, knowing I wanted to be part of a community of driven designers, engineers, and entrepreneurs. 

And over the past year, I found that serving as the Design Lead for ASCE Sustainable Solutions, a competition team within the CEE Department, by leading my team to pitch at Nationals at BYU.

However, through that experience, it really highlighted the importance of considering diverse perspectives, particularly dipping into the consulting realm and understanding real world problem solving with market constraints, political realities, and environmental injustice. 

As I transition into my sophomore year and pursue a simultaneous degree in EEPS, I find myself increasingly drawn to the role of urban economics. ABA’s project impact reflects the new wave of problem solving approaches and social justice, and I’m eager to contribute to this forward-looking approach by stepping foot into professionally developing with more industry experts and a new circle of like-minded problem solvers. Additionally, hearing from members of ABA, and the existing community alongside connections I have with existing members, I truly see myself chasing the high standards ABA members embody.",NPO,Marketing,Business Development,https://drive.google.com/open?id=1jAX7HeNivcz_2LZb4rfPj4Vt5E0jFy2q,"Instagram, Friend",Asian (including Indian subcontinent and Philippines origin),,14,14.0

ABA’s structure of business education and business organization is like an extensive combination of school and work. By acquiring the necessary foundational skills and applying them in hands-on business settings “with” other committee members, I will gain real-world experiences with industry professionals, all while learning “from” others with different skill sets and passions from different committees. I am excited to interact with people from various majors and backgrounds, recognizing the diverse talents and perspectives that each individual uniquely brings to ABA.

Just like how everyone is gathered together during Thanksgiving, the enthusiastic learning and working environment then accumulate into a collaborative family. Chatting about how the day has been or making memories between big little duos, I hope to find a caring family away from my family back home; even beyond mentorship and professional guidance from members of ABA, I value how ABA creates a place where I feel like I belong and can truly be myself—which I was already able to feel throughout info sessions and tabling and would love to be a part of.","My passion for social justice led me to immerse myself in research at UC Santa Cruz’s Race & Social Justice Lab, analyzing media coverage of George Floyd’s murder and the BLM movement. Numerous newspapers framed African-American victims of violence as being “dead,” rather than “killed,” watering down the act of murder to death. This was an eye-opening moment since I was not aware of this prejudice until I learned that it’s a tactic called “euphemistic labeling.”

Analyzing psychological impacts that are unconsciously placed within the context of current racial injustice, I found that pro-white and anti-black framing had more than 80% prevalence in BLM reports, with African-American victims being portrayed as culturally and socially inferior. The statistically significant data provided a clearer picture of how media portrayal feeds systematic racism in America. 

To ensure messages that avoid stereotypes and cultural appropriations, I envision considering factors like ethnicity, gender, and socioeconomic backgrounds in marketing campaigns. Within areas of technology, I hope to implement fair metrics, while developing AI models that identify potential biases towards ethnic groups. With my passion, I envision using my skills to create equality for the next generation and marginalized communities. ABA’s idea of “Learn and Give Back” resonates with me the most as I find ways to make positive ways to reach equity using my technical skills; giving back to the community with time and work is not one on the to-do list, but rather, everything.

However, as I walked past the ABA table stationed near Sather Gate, my interest was immediately piqued. The club members welcomed me with enthusiasm, showing genuine interest not only in consulting but also in learning about my personal experiences. I immediately felt welcomed and comfortable; this feeling has only intensified since I’ve attended club events, participated in coffee chats, and familiarized myself with more members.

Additionally, I’ve been interested in working in the finance industry, and joining a professional organization such as ABA would allow me to gain experience in the field while broadening my perspective. As a part of ABA, I’d be able to provide my expertise in organizing events, team collaboration, analyzing complex data, maintaining budgets, fundraising, and leading teams. 

Through my involvement with ABA, I hope to deepen my understanding of finance, gain insights into consulting, and enhance my professional skills. More importantly, I will gain the wonderful opportunity to be a part of a team that cares about its members and works towards building a united and engaging community. 
","Among the five core ABA principles, ""success through collaboration"" resonates most with me. I thrive in group settings and enjoy leading team projects. In the past, I’ve participated in many teams where we worked together to achieve seemingly impossible goals.

For example, as the President of Fundraising in PTSA, I developed a fundraiser called the Phone-a-thon, where student volunteers called parents, requesting donations to support our school. I assumed complete responsibility for organizing the event, including brainstorming, advertising through posters and announcements, scheduling, and writing numerous emails. Additionally, I assembled a team of student volunteers, created a detailed script to guide them in seeking donations, managed inexperienced students, assisted parents throughout the donation process, cooperated with school admin, and much more. Through my collaboration with student volunteers and school admin, I was able to raise $5,000 for my high school despite social distancing guidelines that had hindered the success of fundraising and my school’s small student body population of merely 180 students. 

Furthermore, I’ve worked with a wide variety of people, ranging from my own family to donors in a foreign country. This past year, I began working towards my goal of providing underprivileged students in my home country with the proper resources to fund their education. I worked alongside my family to reach Nepalese donors and utilize their contributions to further my goal. After countless hours of effort, I raised over $1,500 during one summer.

I mentioned that one of the clubs I was interested in from Calapalooza was Berkeley ABA. To my surprise, Nia was a member of ABA and she was excited to share her experience with me. Like Nia, I’m not 100% sure what I want to do in the future. Nia told me about how ABA has allowed her to explore different career options that appeal to her. At the interest meeting, I learned that most members end up switching teams to try out the plethora of roles ABA offers. From my team experience, I hope to learn more about each role and gauge my interest in each of the departments. I was also pleased with how open everyone was at the interest meeting too. When I told members that I was an Industrial Engineering major, people immediately told me about Will and how I should talk to him. The collaborative spirit and culture in Berkeley ABA make me want to be a member of the club. Above all that, I also want to be in an organization that values having fun. The emphasis on putting the best work forward and throwing the best parties and events is something I find very important. Small things like the club members answering my “seagulls” icebreaker in creative ways and them cheering for each other when they revealed their roles make Berkeley ABA stand out to me as a club. ","JSE – just serious enough. When I ended up at ABA’s booth at Calapalooza, I remember talking to a member about the just serious enough principle. Like ABA, I’ve always stood by the principle “work hard, play hard.” Back in high school, I was president of FBLA and leading up to our competitive season, people would be busy studying and working on their projects and I noticed that many of the members seemed very stressed out and overworked. With the past culture of our branch of FBLA being very “work hard always,” I knew that we needed a change. After all, just like Paul said at the interest meeting “we only have one college {high school} experience.” With the remaining bits of our club’s budget, we planned a trip to Busch Gardens and an eating competition at one of Orlando’s best dining – Crazy Buffet. It was through these two experiences that made our club morale increase tenfold, and we ended up placing the best at states in our school’s history. Today, my school’s branch of FBLA continues to emphasize the JSE principle with big social and trips (this year to Universal) and our club has drawn in many new members interested in joining Eastside’s FBLA family. I find myself following this principle a lot more too now. Yes, it’s important to work hard and put your best forward, but it’s just as important to debrief and do something fun, whether that be exploring the flora and fauna of California or a club party.

I was writing to my counselor about leading a meeting for my nonprofit, New Normal X (NNX). The idea was to engage students in eco-friendly challenges (i.e. shorter showers) by incentivization of volunteer hours. 

After receiving the all-clear, I began working. I coordinated with teachers and tackled new challenges daily, whether it be starting a website, building and recruiting a team or developing strategies for member engagement and incentives. I spent every spare moment improving content, writing research reports, and participating in promotional activities.
Four years later, I had the opportunity to register NNX as a nonprofit and experienced life as a “nonprofit entrepreneur.” Throughout the years, I’ve spoken at public forums in front of hundreds of people, received awards, volunteered hundreds of hours, managed volunteers, gotten recommended as an ambassador for various nonprofits, recruited for paid internships, and much more.

Every part of this journey has enriched me. As a prospective business administration + public health major at Haas, I will continue building upon my NNX experiences. By joining the ABA community, I hope I will be better prepared to expand from the nonprofit sector to corporate America and increase my ability to provide equitable solutions while enriching communities.","ABA’s core value of “just serious enough” best describes me. I consider myself the “silly youngest sister” of my family and always try to find the joy in the little things. When witnessing the classic older sister vs dad fight, I jump in and prevent the next Cold War of the Agrawal household. However, when it’s time to get work done, I can balance a strong work ethic because I truly believe that life doesn’t have to be black or white. 

This mindset has shaped my approach to environmental activism, personal pursuits, and academics. I’m currently learning how to manage my time at Cal and knowing when to play cards with my floor in the study room, and when to work on my homework. I’m deeply passionate about music and arts which relies deeply on discipline. However, the only way to achieve that balance is to know when to giggle with fellow dancers or musicians and when to focus on all your energy on your next move. That makes the process a lot more enjoyable and, honestly, more learning is absorbed as well. This allows me to do meaningful work without losing sight of what makes life fun. 

I try to bring this balance to everything I do- whether it’s practicing, academics, or working with others. I am overjoyed to learn that “just serious enough” is one of ABA’s core values because I want to join a team that understands the “work hard, play hard” idea.

My role involved analyzing customer feedback for a beauty product line, focusing on aligning data insights with real-world applications. Initially, I recommended a Blossom-scented product based on data from Ho Chi Minh City and Hanoi, which suggested a similar consuming preference. However, I soon realized that this analysis overlooked the impact of Hanoi’s drier climate on the product’s benefits compared to Ho Chi Minh City’s humidity. By incorporating regional climate differences into my analysis, I refined our recommendations and highlighted the importance of contextualizing data.\

This experience not only deepened my interest in data science but also showcased the crucial role of understanding data in business strategy. Additionally, collaborating closely with my team at Hakuhodo made me appreciate the value of a supportive, tight-knit community. The way we worked together and tackled challenges left a lasting impression on me.

I am excited about the Analyst Development Program at ABA because it mirrors the collaborative and connected environment I experienced. I believe that ABA’s culture of mentorship and teamwork aligns perfectly with my desire to grow within a cohesive and dedicated group. By joining ABA, I look forward to further developing my analytical skills and contributing to the team’s success, while also giving back by fostering the same sense of community and support that initially drew me to this field.","ABA’s “Learn and Give Back” (#GAIN&GIVE) resonates deeply with me and reflects my core values and experiences. During the Uber Global Hackathon, where I led my team in addressing Uber WAV service challenges, I had the opportunity to put these values into practice.

We tackled significant issues such as long wait times and high cancellation rates for rides involving passengers with disabilities or service animals. To address these challenges, I developed a two-part solution. First, I created a stipend-supported training program for drivers. This program focused on practical skills, like assisting riders with disabilities and managing mobility aids. By enhancing these skills, we aimed to improve service quality and reduce cancellations, which in turn helped boost Uber’s profitability. Second, I introduced an algorithm-based survey to manage driver cancellations related to service animals. This system prompted drivers to regularly update their accommodation status, reducing inefficiencies and supporting profitability.

These experiences taught me the value of aligning strategic solutions with business goals and highlighted the importance of community support. This approach mirrors the interconnected nature of bamboo, which thrives through collective strength and mutual support. Coincidentally, my nickname, ‘Mang,’ meaning young bamboo in Vietnamese, symbolizes resilience and unity. Just as bamboo nurtures each shoot, I am committed to contributing to ABA’s community, using my skills to drive impact while embracing the growth and support that ABA offers.

I also plan to join Wasians at Berkeley. ","Distinct from other Berkeley consulting clubs, I believe that ABA’s five different, structured project teams allows club members to explore a variety of fields and professions. As a college student, I’m not 100% sure about the specific career path I want to pursue after graduation. With ABA, I could get a feel of different career fields with them all falling under the umbrella of business, finance, and economics, which are the areas that I am interested in. 

Looking into the specific project teams, I’m especially excited about the business development team. In my hometown, I had the opportunity to work with the Chamber of Commerce. It is made up of local businesses including small businesses and start-ups. During my internship, I had the opportunity to talk to many business owners about their companies. I’ve learned about how much work goes into growing start-ups, so I’m interested in consulting for Silicon Valley start-ups. 

Through being a member of ABA and working with a team, I hope to join a community of students that support, encourage, and push each other. I hope that I can learn from those around me while having fun with team members that I can also call my close friends. Even after I graduate, I would hope to stay in contact with the ABA members that I worked with and provide support to future ABA members. ","I am best described by the value of Learn and “Give Back”. 

During summer before my senior year, I worked with two rising sixth-graders as a teaching assistant for The Math Movement, a program that taught foundational mathematics. 

Joccian is from East Cleveland, a highly distressed municipality. The state ranks it at one star in student achievement and progress. Joccian explained that she hated math because her teachers never taught her rudimentary concepts. 

The five weeks I spent working with Joccian would not make up for her years of unequal educational opportunity. In our summer program, students were greeted by a multitude of teaching assistants ready to help, but two months later, when these middle school students would return to their school districts, these resources disappeared. The Math Movement aimed to help, and it did in part. Student test scores increased from the start of the program, but the program would not fix the achievement gap that has been prevalent in Greater Cleveland since the 1960s. How could it? The existence of deep-rooted inequality in the education system is not an issue that can be rectified within weeks. To address the inequality in classrooms, we need to concentrate on pervasive inequality in neighborhoods. Righting the achievement gap for the future will require a communal effort, but I hope that the time I spent with students helps them know that I will be a part of that effort, now and in the future.

In a fast-paced world that prioritizes results over relationships and people, the ABA community uplifts and focuses on guiding its members toward success. I want to build practical, hands-on business skills to help me navigate real-world challenges and issues. ABA's focus on industry-based projects offers a chance to apply classroom knowledge realistically. I strive to make a meaningful impact by developing ideas and values through collaboration. Beyond the technical skills, being surrounded by driven and like-minded peers would surely push me to improve and grow. Entering college, I felt lost as to where I should put myself. I looked for a community where I could grow as a person after coffee chatting and hearing the differing perspectives of the members; I love the nurturing and welcoming environment that this club made. I want to join ABA to be more developed in my professional career, enter a network of genuine connections, and contribute to something greater than myself. ","Out of the five ABAs, the learn and give back principle stands out most. Growing up as an older brother and someone who's taken advantage of tutoring, I value teaching what you know. I worked as a math and English tutor for elementary students during my senior year of high school. I picked up the job because I didn't know how to help my younger brother and sister with homework effectively. It wasn't because the assignments were challenging; I didn't know how to teach them. My dad was a military man; I remember being terrified to ask him for help on my multiplication homework. Whenever I'd get something wrong, I could feel his frustration grow. On my first day at Keoni Tutoring, I saw what I would've wished for as a kid. The tutors were so kind and patient that they'd listen to the students even as they ventured down the wrong path, saying just the right things to guide the students to discover the answers themselves. In juxtaposition to my dad's strict, matter-of-fact approach, I found that listening to the students and letting them think brought out their actual intelligence. The idea of active listening is not exclusive to tutoring; it is vital in collaboration to listen to peers and add to their ideas. I value ABA's principle of returning what you learn, and I hope to apply it throughout my future career.

The goal of ABA, in my opinion, is to create well-rounded business leaders by collaboration and practical experience, which is a wonderful fit with my own professional goals. I am excited to get the chance to work on consulting projects with actual clients, particularly in fields like marketing and business development.
I learned a lot about event planning and coordination during my public relations internship, working with media, Key Opinion Leaders (KOLs), and other organizations to make sure a big campaign ran smoothly. I gained knowledge on how to operate effectively under pressure, communicate clearly, and adjust rapidly from this experience. I'm excited to put these talents to use at ABA, where I can hopefully help team projects succeed and gain additional knowledge about business strategies and consulting frameworks. In addition to developing my technical expertise in business or marketing, my goal is to advance both personally and professionally by fostering deep relationships with other members. 
Last but not least, seeing the ABA alumni gain opportunities to work in famous firms like Amazon, and SpaceX is really fascinating, and also represents that ABA could offer professional education in relative fields and resources, which encourages me to apply for ABA.","The event I participated in at Ford's auto exhibition during my public relations internship greatly revealed ""success through collaboration"". 
I started by helping with the setup and planning. This involved relocating supplies, erecting booths, and positioning the vehicles to enhance client interaction. Our team's suggestion to include a test drive, which gave guests a chance to interact with the cars firsthand, was one of the more inventive aspects of the event. We also launched a social media campaign where participants could post using specific hashtags on Weibo and RED (Chinese Twitter and Instagram) to enter to win Ford-branded merchandise. This tactic effectively increased event attendance and digital visibility by fusing offline engagement with online promotion.
Furthermore, we had trouble getting people to notice at the beginning of the event, so we thought a new plan and quickly adjusted by distributing balloons with the Ford logo on them and approaching onlookers to get their attention. This challenge forced me to step outside of my comfort zone, interact with potential customers, and describe the salient features of the cars.
We successfully gained a notable surge in offline engagement and online traction during all of the exhibitions' three days of operation and team work. Along with raising awareness of Ford's new models, the campaign improved my event management, creative problem-solving, strategic communication abilities, and especially collaboration skills.

Through my team experience, I hope to gain insights into leadership, problem-solving, and effective collaboration. I’m excited to apply my strengths in analysis and strategic thinking to ABA's projects and initiatives, while also growing as a communicator and leader. Overall, the opportunity to connect with a diverse, ambitious community that shares my interests in business and consulting is why ABA stands out to me.","My 3rd grade teacher offered me the coveted role of “Class Peacemaker” after noticing that I actively resolved arguments among classmates, helped others with coursework, and befriended anxious students. Being Peacemaker reinforced my existing traits. The mentality to encourage inclusiveness, value differences, and forge solutions has stuck with me ever since.                
I connect with ABA’s core value of learning and giving back most. Inequality in education is a topic I’m passionate about, as I am privileged to have access to a strong education all my life. As a freshman, inspired by the same ‘Peacemaker’ values, I co-founded Cognosphere, a 501(c)3 nonprofit, teaching STEM education to disadvantaged students worldwide.                
Within months, we reached over 1,000 students through virtual sessions in math, coding, and science. Several corporate sponsorships and grants, including one for $6,500 from ‘Goldman Sachs Gives’, and affiliation with HackClub, expanded our reach. 
Within the 6,000 hours and $122,600 of free tech tutoring offered to students, I led the creation and management of courses. Overall, giving back by teaching not only the next generation but also underprivileged students who currently lack the same access to education is important to me, tying me to ABA’s core value of giving back.
Though I won’t be strolling through Sproul wearing my 3rd grade oversized yellow Peacemaker construction vest, I will bring consensus and synergy to all my endeavors at ABA. #GAINANDGIVE!",Strategy,NPO,Business Development,https://drive.google.com/open?id=1Md9zFPb9ejK53u0mL9TdKiR_V_JedmSE,"Instagram, Website, Handbill/Flyer, Friend",Asian (including Indian subcontinent and Philippines origin),,14,15.0

     I’m drawn to ABA for its incredible culture and the diverse, talented community it fosters. From my interactions with ABA members, I’ve found that not only is everyone brilliant, but they are also incredibly approachable, supportive, and kind. The opportunity to work alongside such cool and genuine people in a team environment is what interests me the most about ABA. 
     ABA also aligns with my career goals. With its focus on areas like finance, product management (business development), and strategy, ABA provides the perfect environment for me to grow both personally and professionally while exploring my interest in different fields of business. I’m particularly excited by the high-profile clients that the different ABA teams will be working with this semester. ABA has amazing projects; finance with Meta, product with ADP, and strategy with Marathon. All of these companies are so exciting, and the scope of each project aligns uniquely with my own interests and passions. The idea of being able to grapple with the business problems of these huge corporations and make meaningful recommendations to them is truly exciting. 
     Through ABA, I hope to join a community where I can build meaningful relationships while developing my professional skill set. I’m excited to learn from my peers and mentors, work on impactful projects, and gain relevant experiences in a supportive and fun team environment.","    The value that resonates most with me is  #BE: “Be Humble, Be Ambitious, and Be Tenacious.” My ambitions were what initially motivated me to set my sights on Berkeley. It gave me the confidence to pursue a challenging path, and it was this drive that got me here. However, arriving at Berkeley has been a deeply humbling experience. Surrounded by incredibly talented and brilliant peers, I’ve quickly realized that no matter what I accomplish, there is always more to learn, more to experience, and more to achieve.
     Still, my ambitious nature enables me to persist. Despite the humbling, it has allowed me to pick myself up and keep pushing forward to close the gap. Seeing my peers—people my age—excel and do amazing things has motivated me even further. Their brilliance and excellence has set in motion a flywheel of ambition within myself, daring me to push myself to be greater and greater.
     Tenacity has been at the core of everything I’ve done. I’m familiar with rejection—I wasn’t good enough coming out of high school, so I went to community college. Even there, I faced setbacks, getting turned down for internships and externships. But rejection never broke me; it just made me grind harder. In just one year I pushed through community college, proving my resilience and drive in the face of challenges. Getting into Berkeley was just the start. Now, I’m more determined than ever, inspired by those around me and focused on making the most of every challenge or opportunity I am presented.",Finance,Business Development,Strategy,https://drive.google.com/open?id=1O2l5EcLNz6hZ4kS3uemvxPS2UieDDMNR,"Instagram, Calapalooza, Emily Tang",Asian (including Indian subcontinent and Philippines origin),,14,14.0

I am also part of ISAB (International student association Berkeley) and for that I need another 5 hours a week + a weekend for retreat.","I'm really drawn to ABA because of its culture. The emphasis on taking care of each other while still being humble, ambitious, and tenacious is something I deeply value. I believe success is more than just individual achievements — it’s about growing alongside others, supporting each other, and building something meaningful together. That sense of community and genuine care for one another is what makes ABA stand out to me.

What excites me the most about joining ABA is the chance to not only learn but also to make lasting friendships with like-minded people. I think after talking with the members of the team, especially the seniors of the club like Ellie, David and Daniel care a lot of skill development of newer memebers. I’ve recently set my sights on a career in strategy after interning in corporate finance and M&A advisory, so I know there’s a lot I need to learn. ABA offers an environment where I can gain valuable insights while being surrounded by driven, passionate people. As an exchange student in a new place, being part of a supportive community like ABA would be an incredible experience, both personally and professionally.","The ABA core value that best describes me is ""Be Humble, Be Ambitious, Be Tenacious."" I've always believed that team success outweighs individual effort and that everything can be achieved more effectively by working together rather than focusing solely on oneself. I’ve often found myself leading teams, but I make sure to prioritize fostering a positive and collaborative culture within those teams.

As the Head of the M&A team at the ESSEC Club of Finance and Economics, one of the largest university finance clubs in Europe, I faced a major conflict within the team. To resolve it, I broke the group into smaller teams, with each consisting of members from the three different areas, so they could discuss their issues and recognize that we were all working toward the same goals. This experience reinforced my belief in the power of collective growth, humility, and supporting one another, values that are very close to my heart.",Finance,Strategy,Business Development,https://drive.google.com/open?id=1-WkhxnFCOT0U6godTCTSliWtQiCkxYaf,Calapalooza,White,I am an exchange student and I was asked to mention this on the application,14,14.0

I believe that by surrounding yourself with other driven, ambitious, and open-minded individuals, the possibilities to create a better present and future for oneself are endless. As a first-generation student with two immigrant Mexican parents, I've been taught to take advantage of my available resources, as small or big as they might be. They taught me to always strive to be the best version of myself and to be proud of creating opportunities not just for myself but for the people around me and my community. As part of this RSO, I hope to gain just that: a community of grounded people who come together to seek personal growth through the many different opportunities in a professional environment. 

My interest in business began two years ago when I watched my mom run her childcare center as a business. Seeing her navigate the challenges of leadership, management, and growth showed me how impactful business can be in shaping lives and communities. From communicating with parents to dealing with payroll, I've witnessed how collaboration and shared goals are essential for a thriving business, and I believe that by joining ABA , I will follow my interests while gaining a community of leaders.","What makes me the most happy is giving back to my family and my community. Once I feel at home, I never truly leave. From my gymnastics club in my hometown in Mexico, to now UC Berkeley. I have traveled long distances for greater opportunities and lived in many special places. Yet nothing comes close to the appreciation I will always have for my family and culture back home. I thank everyone before me because as my parents have helped me become the person I am today, they have also paved the way for me to have the opportunity to attend a school as prestigious as Berkeley. Everything I do, I do it with my purpose and identity in mind. I work twice as hard because I know there is someone who came before me that had to work three jobs to keep my house warm, but I also know that there will be someone after me who will not have to worry about the lack of opportunities and representation my Latino community has experienced in past lives. I am passionate about my future, and I am passionate about what it will mean to so many Mexicans after me. That is why ABA's core value of learn and give back resonated with me instantly. I might be one of many driven and ambitious Latino students at the number one public university in the nation, but I will forever advocate that I will not be the last.

With the chance to switch among teams, I will learn a variety of skills that enhance my business acumen as a whole. Since I do not have much prior experience in business, I hope to participate in Analyst Development Program that ABA offers newbies, through which I am able to ground both of my hard and soft skills via doing case analysis, mock interviews and practices. Currently, I am still unsure about my major as I was considering switching my major to environmental economics & policy. I hope my experience in ABA will provide me with a clearer image of what I am really into.

Not only do I hope to acquire business and career-related knowledge in ABA, but I also hope to learn some life lessons from other family members. I would love to hear from life experiences from members. Overall, as a freshman, I am not looking for clubs that focus on a solid career plan. I want to make life-long friends in ABA while accomplishing our assigned projects.
","I love all five values that ABA holds, as they together form ABA. But I will say “Take care of each other” (#ABALOVE) best describes me, and it is also my favorite part of ABA as a caring community. The family sense of ABA recalled my artistic community at high school. Immersed in music and painting with massive strokes of color, I collaborated with workshop members to finish a hand-made rug. This first experience with art therapy was relieving and joyful. 

Motivated to spread the joy of art therapy to heal more people, I founded the Art Therapy Club at my high school. I innovated various creative projects for peers and faculty to accomplish artworks together. For once, we collected natural elements on our campus together to make wreaths in the spring. Gathering branches and leaves in school and weaving them together allowed us to connect with Mother Nature’s magical power and the love involved. The process was therapeutic, picking and sticking leaves onto the branches. All wreaths expressed our current state, either aspiring or disorienting. Art therapy was therapeutic for all and fostered a close-knit artistic community where everyone felt free to express themselves and be themselves, supported by others.

As my favorite artist, Yayoi Kusama said, “I create art for the healing of all humankind in a community.” I hope to engage in ABA’s family, bringing my love, support and passion, and creating some healing experiences together.",Marketing,Strategy,Finance,https://drive.google.com/open?id=1aH932fHL0GYZdJ2nU5mGvMwLgh4YMHgw,"Instagram, Website, Handbill/Flyer",Asian (including Indian subcontinent and Philippines origin),,12,14.0

","As a premedical student, finding a place amongst the maze of consulting organizations at Berkeley can be quite difficult. Thankfully, at ABA, I was able to find a solution that can define my college experience as well as my career. ABA stands out because it aligns perfectly with my goal to gain practical skills beyond the medical field and to work in a collaborative, supportive environment.

ABA’s diverse teams offer a unique chance to explore various aspects of business, from marketing and finance to strategy and NPO consulting. This exposure will help me develop a well-rounded skill set that’s valuable in a medical career, where people-skills and proficiency in management are the holy grail. I’m excited about the Analyst Development Program, which will allow me to dive deep into areas like market research and financial analysis, skills that are transferable and will complement my future career. 

Moreover, ABA’s values resonate strongly with me. My background of constantly moving cities has taught me the importance of adaptability and collaboration, which are core to ABA’s mission. I look forward to contributing to and learning from a team that values mutual support and growth.

Quite frankly, when I am on my deathbed many-many years from now, I want to be glad that I have lived a fulfilling life. Simply learning about one career pathway does not sit well with me. I want to go on side-quests and I want to explore. ABA is a stepping stone to my goals as well as my purpose in life. 
","""Why so serious?"" - The Joker. Ok, but jokes aside, this quote encapsulates a lot of my experiences throughout my life, which is why when I saw the core value titled ""JUST SERIOUS ENOUGH"", I was very excited. I have always wanted to have fun in whatever I do, I play tennis because its fun, I watch Lego Ninjago because its fun, and I eat at random restaurants because IT IS FUN! I believe fundamentally that if you strip the enjoyment from doing something, you'll inevitably see a loss in engagement.

During my time tutoring kindergarteners in CODING (Bay Are Moment), I learned to strike a balance between being disciplined and making learning enjoyable. I kept the lessons structured and focused, but I also incorporated games and interactive activities to keep the kids engaged. For example, while sticking to a lesson plan, I used playful exercises to make math more accessible and fun. This approach helped my students stay motivated and absorb the material effectively, showing that a serious commitment to their education can still include elements of fun and excitement.

I always liked de-stressing with my friends after a long day of work by hanging out, building legos, karaoke. LITERALLY ANYTHING. I do believe that learning is maximized when fun is involved. Joining ABA excites me because it aligns with this approach—striving for excellence while ensuring that we enjoy the journey.

I intend on joining a Christian dance team called ABBA Modern with one practice per week on Sundays. My participation in the dance team will not affect my ABA performance.  ","ABA is my gateway in unlocking the best of both worlds, beautifully combining two aspects within a career that I’ve grown to cherish and be passionate about: Consulting and Community. Each member of ABA is capable of having their own professional interests as expressed by the five different teams, but are also not restricted to just one branch. Whether that be helping BMW dealers organize their database with the Business Developement team or pitch new flavor ideas under Marketing, the creative projects partnering with ABA are quite versatile. My time with the Elderly Embrace Care Network, a nonprofit liaising elderly and society, has allowed me to dip my feet in the NPO pool and has sparked my interest in potentially working with them again. As someone that has been interested in nonprofit engagement one year and social media marketing the year after that, being given the opportunity to explore various specialties would allow me to dedicate whole heartedly to multiple areas of my interests and familiarize myself within this ever-growing industry. 
The move from Southern California to Berkeley hasn’t been the smoothest of transitions and in terms of providing a community, ABA has radiated so much love just from my experience at coffee chats and the case workship. From their retreats that have involved ice skating in Yosemite and monthly socials to the Big-Little mentorship program, there is no doubt in my mind that ABA consists of a fun – and of course, just serious enough – people. ","As I stared at the ABA core values, I carefully considered each one and pondered which of the five I resonated the most with. Time and time again, I found myself circling back to the same two: Learn and Give Back (#Gain&Give) and Just Serious Enough. My four years with Key Club and District 30 South has taught me so much, exposing me to philanthropy at a young age and providing me with a passionate group of individuals. Becoming both a district and chapter officer allowed me to give back to the community that has been the backbone of my early high school career, in hopes of giving another freshman an experience close to what I shared. The second core value, Just Serious Enough, encases my personality and the professional environment that I want to surround myself within. I want to laugh and simply enjoy the work I do, while also being teachable, cooperative with my peers, and embodying professionalism to our clients – something that ABA shows me with every interaction regardless of small or big.

I believe that humility and ambition work hand-in-hand, as it is crucial to recognize that there is always more to learn while striving toward lofty goals. My past experiences reflect this value through both my approach to personal growth and my commitment to working collaboratively.

During my internship with the North County Transit District, I had the opportunity to participate in various strategic planning initiatives. While I brought enthusiasm and ambition to each project, I remained humble, recognizing the expertise of my colleagues and being open to learning from their guidance. By listening actively and working as part of a team, I contributed to successful marketing campaigns and learned invaluable lessons that will shape my future endeavors.

Additionally, my experience at community college reinforced this value. As a student in debate and communication classes, I continuously pushed myself to improve, embracing feedback and seeking ways to better my skills. At the same time, I worked with classmates on group projects, where I learned the importance of collaboration and appreciation for the contributions of others.

By being humble yet tenacious in my pursuit of excellence, I am always asking, ""What's next?"" and striving for continuous improvement while lifting up those around me.

Besides the obvious top tier professional development that ABA offers for each member, I’ve come to see that ABA is a family of fun and supportive people who will facilitate your personal growth and last beyond my time at Berkeley.

When it comes to professional development, I’m drawn to ABA’s first class client profile, having consulted on cross-sector strategy and growth for Fortune 500 and pro bono companies alike for 20+ years. By going through the project pipeline and learning the hard and soft skills that coincide, I hope to transfer unique perspectives and expertise into scaling my marketing agency, Amplify, into a dominating player in the retail e-commerce SaaS space. I’ve also learned of the professional emphasis that ABA uses to help consultants and advisors alike maintain their mental acuity and attain roles in the world’s most impactful firms. These are invaluable tools that I see myself quickly picking up to most effectively scale my startup - whether it be through onboarding talent or raising more funding.

From reaching 20 thousand steps in Yosemite to spontaneous chumming sessions, I think ABA will define a pivotal, rewarding aspect of my college experience, giving me the opportunity to build relationships with genuine and empathetic peers who are just serious enough. It’d be a privilege to join this tight-knit family and be provided with a path to realize more of my full potential in both a professional and a nonprofessional capacity.
","My experience leading the Global Philanthropy Leadership Program as a part of the Microfinance Club in rural Hunan, China exemplifies how I resonate with ABA's principle of ""Learn and Give Back."" Our stay in Dagouyuan Village was a continuous cycle of acquiring knowledge and using it to make a positive impact on others as I led eight club members in evaluating rural farmers as loan candidates through SWOT and PESTLE analyses.

As I spent time with Grandma Song and other villagers, I immersed myself in their culture, eager to understand their way of life. I bonded with local children, who, in exchange for lessons in financial literacy, taught me to play the diabolo. Connecting with locals and learning their traditions, I saw how our loans affected villagers on a personal level, rather than just analytical. 

Upon returning as co-president of the Microfinance Club, I dedicated myself to teaching the application of theoretical concepts in managerial accounting in a real-world setting to our 40+ members. Having experienced first-hand microfinance’s impact when practiced with a guiding humanitarian philosophy - be it with the migrant farmers, eager children, or earnest members of my club - this experience has solidified my belief that true leadership involves an openness to learning from every situation and individual we encounter. As I move forward in my career and life, I am dedicated to continuing to gain and give, always seeking new ways to use my knowledge and skills to create purposeful connections, strengthen communities, and positively impact others' lives.
