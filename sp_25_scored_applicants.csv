While all the consulting clubs on campus have a competitive edge, many seem to overdo the competitiveness aspect, especially within the club. ABA, on the other hand, offers a perfect balance between a strong work mentality and a sense of community. As depicted on the website, community is a large aspect of the club, which many other clubs overlook. In addition, the five core values of ABA exemplify this ambition to form a community within the club, which I was interested in. Furthermore, the fact that ABA offers 5 different team projects is intriguing as it allows for club members to test out different fields of work before deciding upon a career path. In terms of what I hope to gain, it all leads back to working as a team. I want to gain lifelong friendships and learn how to improve my skills as a team player. I am eager to integrate some of the ABA core values into my team experience, including learn and give back and care for each other. With these values, I hope to create an 
exceptional working environment while continuously learning from my peers.  ","The ABA core value that best describes me is learn and give back. While unrelated to consulting or finance in general, many of my past experiences lean on this principle. For example, throughout middle school and early high school, I continuously learned about the impact our actions have upon the environment. From waste being thrown into the sea to global warming impacting the coral reefs, I felt responsible for the actions of all humans towards our aquatic environment. After learning all this information, I attempted to find any possible avenue I could take that would help teach people about humanity's impact on the oceans and what we can do to help. In this search, I discovered SurfRider, a national organization committed to restoring and protecting the oceans. Having learned about their mission, I decided to start a chapter at my high school in order to educate my peers about the impacts of humans and to find solutions to combat these impacts. After starting the club as a sophomore, over 100 people joined the club and came to our beach clean-ups to learn about what I discovered in middle school. Whilst the club was successful, my proudest moment and one that truly demonstrates the learn and give back value was being able to teach the 2nd graders from my school about the impact of humans on the environment Having been able to give back in that way was truly amazing as I felt that I was able to serve the world through efforts.

And there is no better place to do it than the oldest, one of the most prestigious business clubs at Cal. On top of working with the largest companies in the world, having the opportunity to do so within a specific concentration is what really differentiates ABA. As my goal is to build a career in finance, I already know which team I am trying to join. Alongside the professional development and gaining hands-on experience, being around for so long as a club, allows it to have an established culture and an extensive network, regardless of the career path I want to pursue, which I am excited about. I really see myself thriving here if I make it. Besides the professional benefits, the club provides a community within a huge school. I would love people in ABA to become my lifelong friends who I share the passion of business with and a curious mind. Both the social and professional aspects of ABA Consulting makes it a top choice for me.","An idea that resonates with me to this day is giving back (learn and give back). After I successfully completed one of my internships, I thanked the professor that helped me secure that internship. After seeing my final deliverables, he told me he is proud of me, I was very welcome and ended his message with this: “Find somebody that could use some help. And pay it forward.” The following winter, the senior year of high school, some of my friends and I decided to organize a financial literacy community involvement project for middle school students. As economics and finance are some things I am passionate about, I felt both comfortable and thrilled to teach the next generation some of the fundamentals. We prepared a reasonable and practical curriculum and held Zoom meetings over the winter break. Some of the topics included investing, risks, and budgeting which are important topics at every level of finance. Also, in order to make the learning experience more effective we added games between lectures and made them as interactive as possible. Seeing the kids excited to learn really made my heart warm and it was then I realized what my professor meant by “pay it forward.”",Finance,Business Development,Strategy,https://drive.google.com/open?id=1yLg-IOzyIa9I1wPB0r51ydlZKN4-AeX9,"Instagram, Website, Handbill/Flyer, Friend, Calapalooza",Middle Eastern,,25.0,25.0

Clubs/Orgs— Tau Kappa Epsilon, Undergraduate Research","ABA, a consulting club with diverse ethnic and academic backgrounds, encourages both the personal and professional development of its members, supporting their niche passions and exploring a variety of companies and organizations that don’t fit a “cookie cutter” interest. If in ABA, I’d like to develop both my hard and soft skills for consulting and business-adjacent projects. For hard skills, I’d like to be familiar with the business jargon and professional know-how that is required for future, on-the-job work experience. For soft skills, I’d like to reinforce my professional confidence and collaborative skills that are applicable to every aspect of professional and personal life.

In particular, ABA’s website boasts a wide range of companies like Google, Airbnb, Microsoft, and others that I’d like to explore as potential employers in the future. Speaking with ABA’s tablers and coffee-chaters, I am intrigued by the support for biotech or healthcare focused projects that have occurred in past semesters. As someone who would like to pursue jobs like biotechnological research and healthcare financial analysis, this niche specialization in ABA makes ABA a comfortable and encouraging environment for me to learn more about these aforementioned professions through hands-on and real-life work experiences. 

And finally, members rave about the tight-knit community that is ABA. As a freshman from Hawaii, I came to Berkeley with a small-ish network. Throughout my first semester, I was blessed to create the network I did, but ABA provides a social opportunity for me to meet more friends, pursue new projects, and expand my professional and personal network.","#JSE, or Just Serious Enough, is the perfect way to describe my aspirations in professional and personal life. Berkeley, an academically rigorous university, can be quite challenging at times. However, upon the completion of my first semester, I was astounded to find that Berkeley can actually be a lot of fun! A “work hard, play hard” schooling environment, I feel right at home and my past experiences display that.

As a self-proclaimed serial entrepreneur, I’ve explored a number of projects throughout my professional journey. ecobox, a sustainability start-up I founded in 2021, was a project I pursued with my friends. They tell you not to work with your friends; and admittedly, it can be difficult. However, compartmentalizing between work and fun was the most valuable lesson I learned throughout my start-up experiences. 

However, simultaneously, #INIT2GETHER, or Success Through Collaboration, is my bread and butter. I, throughout my high school career, found that teamwork is something I enjoy a lot. As a Division Head for Punahou Carnival — a social fair hosted by my high school school fully run by student leaders, I collaborated with my peers to host a carnival hosting 15,000 attendants from all over the globe. Though it was tiring work, spending hours picking mangoes, hosting donation drives, building the actual facilities, and working the carnival itself, we, as a team, were able to get it done, raising ~2 million dollars for financial aid!

I hope to gain knowledge and skills to improve myself for future endeavors in the Business world as well as new friends and people who I enjoy to be around.,The core that I resign with the most is the #GAIN&GIVE. Last summer I went to Vietnam and taught English to an elementary/middle school which was super fun and a great experience. I also ran a club in my high-school where I taught 10 people how to day trade. I also coached and ran a summer program for my local club soccer team where I taught players aged 12-15 how to implement tactics and techniques to improve their game.

Berkeley Women in Business ","The ABA Idea: to use collaboration to brainstorm solutions and build community –which is exactly what I aim to do by influencing individuals to solve real-life social, economic, and political problems. I believe that as technology continues to progress, grassroots community efforts are increasingly required to use it for social good. My desire to pave the way for underrepresented individuals and affirm them as valuable and important to the community aligns greatly with ABA’s drive to foster more connections within Berkeley students.

ABA offers me the opportunity to engage in my passion for impactful business as well as learn skills to analyze strategy and industry. The community of consultants passionate about different fields like finance, marketing, and strategy motivates me to explore my career field.  I hope that I can learn how to approach problems with a multidisciplinary perspective, develop effective communication and leadership skills, and leverage the strengths of diverse individuals. 

At ABA, I know I will join a community of equally dedicated changemakers. The culture of creating impact and supporting each other with internships and resume building, and connecting students with companies fosters values of helpfulness and kindness towards others. ABA is the perfect greenhouse for me to expand my knowledge in social impact research by applying it to the consulting field and give me opportunities to create my own creative project with support from the wonderful #ABAteam. ","As I watched the documentary The Swimmers in ninth grade, I was so intrigued by the story of two Syrian refugees who traveled across the Aegean Sea to escape war. As I learned about their struggles, I was inspired by their persistence and I instantly knew that I wanted to help refugees in some way. 

Seeing a gap in the resources offered for the educational and welfare aspects of refugee life, I founded Voiceopedia, a nonprofit that provides educational and financial aid for refugees and gives them a voice in the community.

Initially, it was difficult to get in contact with refugees however, we figured out a way to do this through partnering with other companies such as the International Rescue Committee. We began launching backpack, school-supply, and self-care drives to help refugee families adapt to their new environment. We wanted to do more to advocate for the intergenerational trauma refugees face as a result of socioeconomic and cultural factors and therefore launched and distributed an academic research paper. 

Last summer, we created a financial literacy and public speaking camp and taught refugee children to be independent and advocate for themselves. I noticed the first day the students were shy and afraid to participate, but after months in our program, I saw them fight to answer questions and speak with confidence.  

At ABA, I will continue to strive to learn and understand others and take that knowledge to help give back to the community, making them feel accepted and heard.

","I’m insatiably curious and a chronic problem solver. When in a new city, I look at the layout and wonder, “where do people live and how do they get to work? Are there walkable places to eat and socialize? Why do the streets need to be so wide?” When others go sightseeing, I see problems that need to be solved and improvements to be made. I want to be join ABA  because I want to learn from some of the best problem solvers at Berkeley analyzing some of the most complex problems in the Bay Area can offer. I can add value and contribute to ABA's culture of excellence because I’m creative yet analytical, thrive in project-based environments, and am happiest collaborating with or leading a diverse team whose skills will certainly exceed mine. With majors in Sustainable Environmental Design and Environmental Economics, as well as a minor in Structural Engineering, I want to build environments that not only accommodate but elevate humanity, and advance a sustainable and interconnected future. I believe my curious, creative yet analytical, problem-solving nature and my inclusive, flexible leadership style makes me an ideal candidate for Berkeley ABA

","The ABA's core value of Success Through Collaboration best describes me as a problem-solver. I believe my creativity and ability to analyze and distill complexity stems partly from my passions for creative writing and being an ensemble musician. Through creative writing, I honed my ability to build new worlds, rich in complexity, that communicated my vision and hooked the reader. Similarly, I look at a 200 year old piece of music that has been performed thousands of times before, and find a fresh way to articulate a complex arrangement of notes along with a hundred other musicians. As captain of my water polo team, Trek Leader of my crew, or an Eagle Scout leading my troop, I often led colleagues or teammates who surpassed me in ability, knowledge, or experience. I learned to build successful teams by leveraging each person’s individual strength, solicit different perspectives, and communicate a shared vision. I learned to remain flexible in the face of unforeseen circumstances or obstacles. During my Eagle Scout project where I designed and constructed a play structure to train service dogs for wounded veterans, I realized I couldn’t transport the half-a-ton structure as planned. Moving the assembly before the next morning was critical to completing the project on time. My team and I improvised a solution inspired by a “shoulder-dolly” product I had seen at Home Depot. Whether in water polo, trekking the outback, constructing a play-structure, or consulting, projects rarely proceed as planned. I’ve learned to remain calm, pivot, and adjust to ever-changing circumstances.

I have always been a strong leader due to my organizational skills and my ability to work well in a team. I have also learned a great deal of life lessons from mentors, my parents, teachers, friends, and more. ABA embodies both sides of leadership through its mission to create strong business leaders, but also through its various teams that learn valuable skills from older members. I believe that I would learn valuable lessons from mentors in ABA, and in the future could become a mentor and role model for other students. I am also interested in ABA for the community aspect. Although I have found some amazing communities at Berkeley that I feel closely connected to, I would love to join more. Different communities allow me to gain a diverse point of view and learn from my peers that are similar and different from me. If I have the opportunity to join ABA, I hope to gain both social and academic experience through the team I am assigned to work with. I hope to learn more about the business world by communicating and learning about ABA’s different clients. Being able to communicate, organize, speak publicly, and finish projects on time are important skills that I want to develop before I graduate college. I also hope to connect and collaborate well with my team to foster meaningful friendships that could last a lifetime. ","Out of ABA’s five core values, I believe that the value #INIT2GETHER or Success Through Collaboration aligns with me the most. Throughout high school, there were several instances where I stepped up as a leader and built a team to collaborate with. First, during my junior year of high school, vandals drew racist messages in the bathrooms and in the main hallway of my school. Due to the stress and unhappiness of the faculty and students, I decided that our school needed something to bring everyone together. I became the director of the Diversity Artwork Commission, which was a group of about 30 students that designed, created, and installed a mural in the front wing of our school. The mural celebrates diversity and inclusivity with characters from all sorts of backgrounds, ethnicities, clubs, teams, and more. This mural was the main legacy I left at my high school and reminds students to be considerate and accepting of one another. My work as director of DAC aligns with the #INIT2GETHER value because it would not have been possible to create a large artwork that impacted our school community without collaboration from students. Here at Berkeley, I am the Director of Internal Social Events at Alpha Phi. I am in charge of planning our internal events, communicating with venues, transportation, and other houses to make sure events run smoothly. In my sorority, there are a countless number of positions that all contribute to making our house successful. This embodies the #INIT2GETHER value as well. If I am able to join ABA, I look forward to collaborating in a group and leading some projects.

By forming friendships that will last long after I graduate, I hope to make the most of my four years of college.
I'm drawn to ABA not just to study business concepts but also to be a part of a community that supports and promotes one another. I think working on a team with other driven, aspirational people sounds like a fantastic way to challenge oneself and create enduring relationships. I've always believed that the finest ideas come from working as a team, and I know that working with some amazing people at ABA will provide me with the chance to accomplish just that. Along with gaining work experience, I hope to build a community with ABA—people with whom I can develop, learn, and create memories.","One of ABA's core principles that really speaks to me is ""Learn and Give Back."" I've tried my best to teach what I've learned to others, especially throughout my time working as a lead tutor in high school. I taught math and English to underprivileged elementary school students for four years. As crucial as helping them understand the material was boosting their self-esteem. I also helped to mentor more junior tutors, creating a welcoming environment for everybody.
That way of thinking has affected other aspects of my life. I've worked as a teacher assistant at Berkeley Company Academy for Youth, where I've given kids the resources and constructive criticism they need to realize their company ideas. Even with my coaching program, Jun's Soccer, it was never just about soccer; it was also about mentoring children and watching their personal development.

In my previous role as a peer tutor in a local community center, I dedicated myself to mastering complex subjects and subsequently sharing that knowledge with fellow students. This experience not only reinforced my understanding but also highlighted the importance of mentorship.

Additionally, during my internship at GFI, I proactively sought opportunities to acquire new skills in management. Recognizing the value of this knowledge, I organized meetings to train incoming interns, ensuring they were well-equipped to contribute effectively.

I am drawn to ABA because this business and analytics program coincides with my aim for refinement in crucial skills such as problem-solving, leadership, and communication. Working on real case studies with associates with a passion for business and analytics will enrich my perspectives and enable me to meaningfully contribute to team projects.

Collaboration has been one key defining aspect throughout my experiences: leadership, academics, community service. Founding SparkSTEM included building a team to develop the mentorship program and organize the workshops in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics for youngsters. This required not only teamwork but also the ability to step up as a leader while making sure that everyone's contribution was valued. Similarly, I have also joined my co-students at DubCarePacks in putting together and distributing care packages that prove the might of people in unison. Beyond leadership, my work as a Kumon tutor underlined the importance of collaboration in supporting students; it required flexibility, patience, and clear communication to accommodate learning strategies particular to their needs. These experiences instilled in me the belief that success is best achieved when individuals support one another and take ownership of their roles within a team.

From this, I hope to bring my collaborative mindset into team projects at ABA: being able to contribute ideas while learning from others.

I spoke with many current members, and I would love to enter their family and become one of them. I was impressed by their passion, their ambition, and by the interesting experiences and projects that they had the opportunity to build and lead as a team. Those conversations made me very excited about ABA, as I could see people I felt I resonate with, who share my curiosity and drive for success. My hope for the future is therefore to learn technical skills that school doesn’t teach me, but that are essential for my future job, and to form meaningful connections with teammates who push each other to be better. I want to surround myself with people who challenge me, inspire me, and share a passion for continuous learning. 
I also hope, through this experience, to refine my ability to work in a high-performing team, develop leadership skills, and gain hands-on exposure to business strategy and problem-solving. At the same time, I am eager to contribute my own perspective and experiences to the team.","The ABA core value “Gain & Give” resonates deeply with me as an Italian student who came to the United States to learn and grow, with the ultimate goal of giving back to my home country. Two years ago, during my exchange program in Santa Cruz, I conducted interviews with students, counselors, and professors at Stanford University and UC Berkeley to better understand how the American college admissions process works—an aspect that is largely unknown to students in Italy.
When I returned to Veneto, I visited several local schools to share what I had learned. Through presentations and videos from my interviews, I explained the American university application process, offering practical advice to students who, like me, dream of studying abroad but lack the resources or guidance to navigate the system. This experience taught me the power of mentorship and how sharing knowledge can inspire others to pursue opportunities they might not have considered possible.
Looking ahead, I want to continue embodying ""Gain & Give.""

With a background in psychology, I’ve always been fascinated by human behavior– what drives decision-making, how people interact with brands, and how businesses can leverage these insights to create meaningful connections. This curiosity naturally led me to an interest in consumer psychology and marketing, areas where consulting provides a dynamic and impactful way to apply these concepts. ABA’s diverse range of sectors excites me because it allows me to explore different industries while honing my problem-solving and data-driven decision-making skills.
Through my team experience, I hope to gain hands-on exposure to marketing strategies and learn how psychological principles shape consumer behavior in business settings. Additionally, I want to strengthen my skills in data analysis and coding, an area I was introduced to in my Research and Data Analysis in Psychology class. Applying these analytical skills to consulting projects will allow me to develop a deeper understanding of market trends and consumer insights. Ultimately, I see ABA as the perfect opportunity to bridge my interests in psychology and business, gain valuable consulting experience, and contribute innovative solutions to make a tangible impact.","#INIT2gether. Collaboration has been at the core of many of my experiences, teaching me the importance of stepping up as a leader while also supporting my team.
My main hobby is playing the cello, and I’ve been a part of an orchestra for eleven years. Over the years, I’ve had the privilege of serving as both the principal cellist and a section player, which has taught me the importance of both leadership and teamwork. As a principal cellist, I’ve developed skills in guiding others, setting the tone for the section, facilitating discussions, and ensuring cohesion in performances. As a section player, I’ve learned the value of listening, adapting, and contributing to a collective sound. Playing the cello has not only deepened my appreciation for music but also strengthened my ability to work collaboratively with others toward a shared goal. Whether it’s preparing for concerts or navigating challenging pieces, the experience has instilled in me a sense of perseverance and the joy of collective effort.
Furthermore, as a research assistant at the Golden Bear Sleep & Mood Research Clinic, I work closely with a team to analyze data and contribute to treatment development for underserved populations. While I initially took on a more supportive role, I quickly learned that leadership isn’t about a title– it’s about taking initiative, asking the right questions, bouncing around ideas, and ensuring that the team moves forward together.

With my friends at ABA telling me about their experiences, I believe ABA offers the perfect environment to grow as a well-rounded person who can balance innovation and strategy to achieving my long-term goal of starting my own business.
Post the info sessions and tabling events, I am particularly intrigued by the structured mentorship/ development programs for freshmen, which I know will challenge me to think critically, communicate effectively, and refine my ability to provide data-driven insights. I see ABA as a medium to not only build technical and strategic acumen but also to develop meaningful relationship with like-minded individuals who have similar mindsets for work and social lives.
By joining the Business Development or the Strategic Consulting team, I wish to get hands on experiences in analyzing real world business challenges and producing strategies that drive innovation and growth in businesses. Working with startups and major corporations will help me understand the different organization dynamics, from scaling products in emerging markets to optimizing strategies for well-established companies. 
","The fifth core value is probably the one that best describes me #JSE: Just Serious Enough. I strongly believe that one needs to balance their professionalism, academics and work with an equal sense of social life, camaraderie, and enjoyment. This approach has allowed me to grow while maintaining a healthy and positive outlook on challenges throughout high school and in college till now. For example, I used to play football (soccer) on a national level by representing my state Gujarat in India. Balancing days of tour for matches and long weekly practice sessions with my research projects and academics allowed me to excel in all of these areas without losing out on any of them, while making sure I had enough time to spend time with my friends, my girlfriend, and my siblings.

What draws me most to ABA is its core values, which set it apart from the many consulting clubs tabling on Sproul. Upon reading about the deeper meanings behind these values and coffee chatting with members about their experiences, I felt a genuine connection to ABA’s mission and community—compelling me to apply.

Beyond gaining valuable work experiences, I want to grow professionally by developing better teamwork, communication, public speaking, and presentation skills. I believe that these skills are important in every industry, and I hope that ABA consulting would be the best place to learn and develop them further. ABA fosters the ideal environment to develop these skills while working alongside like-minded, driven individuals. Moreover, I see consulting as an avenue not only for business problem-solving but also for creating meaningful social impact. Through ABA, I hope to expand my contributions beyond business by working on projects that intersect with international relations, healthcare, education, and environmental sustainability. By joining ABA, I aim to challenge myself to grow as a leader, and make a lasting impact.","With over 1,000 hours of community service throughout high school, I am deeply committed to bringing about positive change. Among ABA’s five core values, I believe that #Gain&Give best defines me. When my family moved from Berkeley to Merced, I was shocked by the disparities between the two communities. Despite being in one of the wealthiest states, the Central Valley has a majority of students falling below state educational standards and high poverty rates.To address this, I became an academic mentor, a peer-assisted learning mentor for special education students, a swim coach, and co-founded a community service club during COVID-19. However, my greatest impact was serving as the Director of Activities and Historian for my school’s Future Business Leaders of America (FBLA) chapter.

My chapter was not well-established, lack study materials, guidance from past competitors, and hands-on mentoring. So I took the initiative to self-study online resources, review college accounting books, and enroll in a financial accounting course  to become one of the first students at my school to qualify for the 2023 National FBLA Leadership Conference in Atlanta. From this experience, I learned the importance of direct mentoring to guide students toward success. So I began utilizing my accounting knowledge and competitive experiences to mentor Accounting 1 students— two of whom placed at section conferences the following year. To ensure long-term impact, I established a peer-mentoring system to connect underclassmen with senior members, to create opportunities for valuable guidance and academic support. Through ABA, particularly its nonprofit team, I hope to expand my social impact by supporting NGOs and their missions.

Looking through the website, I was especially impressed by the feedback from the Wells Fargo client—it really highlighted ABA’s ability to drive real world change for large organizations. The ABA community stood out to me as an opportunity for me to connect and network with like-minded individuals who share similar goals and interests. I hope by being part of this organization will not only contribute towards my personal growth, but also to upheld the ABA's prestigious reputation. 

What sets ABA apart from other organizations for me is its focus on awareness and advocacy—elements that require attention to detail and flawless execution. A great idea is meaningless without proper execution, and I appreciate how ABA emphasizes both the strategic and practical sides of making an impact.

Through my involvement with ABA, I hope to develop my expertise and creativity by working alongside professionals and tackling challenges faced by major companies. I thrive under pressure and seek opportunities to push my limits. I’m excited to be part of a team that encourages me to go beyond what I thought was possible, helping me reach new heights of personal and professional growth.","Of the Five Core values, the one that describes me the best would be the passion for helping others. I have always had a passion for helping others and creating an environment where everyone can succeed because I found that, that is the best way to increase productivity and growth overall. Inclusivity and exclusion rarely work and usually end up hurting everyone's progress. Therefore lending a helping hand has always been my mission so everyone can succeed and build a better and brighter future. 

As for what I have done to demonstrate this value, I have created a website previously that helps students with homework and life from K-12. In addition to that, I offered free tutoring through a volunteer program for high school and college students which helped countless students across California. Lastly, with my outreach, I thought about how I could push for a larger impact. So I created affordable snacks and quality clothes from wholesale that were for sale and could be bought for $10 including shipping. The profit margins were thin but the main goal at the time was to help students and families. Overall, I accomplished my goal to help others and I hope to do more in the future.

Everyone who goes through ABA’s professional training doesn’t just gain technical skills—they come out as incredible communicators and teammates. That’s the kind of environment I want to be part of: fast-paced, professional, and genuinely enriching.

Not joining ABA in my freshman fall was a regret, but I used that time to grow. I interned at a search fund, Redwood Succession, and later at a boutique bank, Horizon Partners. Through those experiences, I learned how tough it is to navigate technicals without guidance and how brutal recruiting can be without support. It made me realize just how valuable a community like ABA is.

Now, I know exactly why I want to join. ABA isn’t just about career growth—it’s about having people who truly have your back. It’s about mentorship that goes beyond networking and friendships that extend far past graduation. I saw that ABA isn’t just professional and ambitious—it’s personal, intimate, and deeply connected. To me, that’s what defines college, and I can’t think of anything more rewarding than being part of it.","I think #Be — Be Humble, Be Ambitious, Be Tenacious — is what describes me best among ABA’s five core values.

One example was when I and my friend launched an online platform to raise awareness about issues like education, meritocracy, and how media shapes young minds. At the time, most popular content focused on trends and entertainment, but we wanted to create something deeper—something that sparked meaningful conversations.

When we first pitched the idea, we were met with skepticism. People told us, “This is a waste of time” or “No one will care.” That was tough to hear, but we truly believed in what we were building. Instead of giving up, we adapted. Without access to major promotional channels, we relied on grassroots strategies—conducting live surveys and interviews on busy streets to engage people directly and build interest.

It worked. Once one of our articles hit 1,000 views, we went back to the same skeptics—this time with results. The perception changed, and what was once dismissed as irrelevant gained traction.

This experience taught me that you don’t need everyone’s approval to succeed. Sometimes, you have to prove yourself first and let the results speak for themselves. More importantly, I learned the value of persistence and creative problem-solving, especially when things don’t go as planned. These qualities—determination, adaptability, and resilience—are what I will bring to finance, where patience, quick thinking, and the ability to push forward are key to overcoming challenges.",Finance,Business Development,Strategy,https://drive.google.com/open?id=1OrZC-aEICNt4wO1l0YnUWzxjLNyI3WSI,"Instagram, Website, Handbill/Flyer, Friend, Calapalooza",Prefer not to say,,28.0,28.0

Through ABA, I’m excited to gain hands-on experience working with healthcare organizations and nonprofits, where I can apply my analytical and research skills to solve issues within the medical and legal systems. The opportunity to engage with healthcare companies and nonprofits aligns perfectly with my commitment to addressing racial bias and systemic inequities in healthcare. I am thoroughly interested in the legal aspects in the medical field and healthcare systems. More specifically, I’d like to focus my career on healthcare equity and policy. As a minority, I am passionate about racial bias amongst medical professionals and systems. At Berkeley, I’ve researched these topics, ranging from the impacts of systemic racism on the healthcare algorithms, to blatant racism in fields such as obstetrics. This research has solidified my commitment to using the law to advance healthcare equity, advocate for underrepresented communities, and ensure that all patients receive the care and respect they deserve. Working on consulting projects with healthcare companies through ABA would allow me to combine my passion for law, public health, and social justice, while developing key skills in case analysis, policy research, and strategic planning. Additionally, ABA’s mentorship and community-focused approach stand out to me. I’m eager to collaborate with like-minded peers, learn from experienced professionals, and refine my leadership abilities as I continue to explore how business, law, and healthcare intersect.","The ABA core value that best describes me is #INIT2GETHER – Success Through Collaboration. I believe that teamwork is essential to achieving meaningful results, and my past experiences have consistently reinforced this belief. Through Berkeley’s URAP Program, I’ve worked with Rapid Reviews Infectious Diseases, an editorial newspaper dedicated to fast tracking the publication process for medical research. Established in 2019, during the outbreak of COVID-19, a large amount of critical medical research was being posted and could not be further validated in a timely manner. An increase in medical research publication strengthens public awareness on pressing health issues. As a research fellow for this company, I researched medical preprints that I believed to have considerable potential and pitched them to our editorial team for further consideration. From this point, a team and I would sort through our potential papers and find reputable reviewers for these papers. This research project resonates with me because I am passionate about public health, and with each publication of a research article, I felt the impact I was making to raise awareness on medical discoveries. By helping facilitate the rapid dissemination of critical health information, I directly contributed to public health awareness, resulting in the potential to drive positive change in healthcare practices and policies. Additionally, this project greatly improved my collaboration skills, and I truly learned so much from the people on my team.

Haas Business Student Association: 3 hrs/week","My first experience with consulting happened in a non-traditional setting: a non-profit called MountainWatch. Throughout high school, I worked extensively in sustainability, and witnessed firsthand how environmental non-profits struggle to implement effective initiatives due to lack of funding and community engagement. Knowing that MountainWatch sought to restore an ecologically important species, the Elfin Butterfly, I spearheaded a self-sustaining restoration project for the organization. 

For this project, I applied for a grant through the Elfenworks Foundation, writing a comprehensive project proposal and ultimately securing $60,000 in funding to revive the Elfin Butterfly. I subsequently designed educational programming, developed marketing materials, recruited volunteers, sourced vendors, and oversaw the entire project budget in collaboration with MountainWatch executives. At the time, I did not realize it, but all of the tasks I completed were components of consulting. 

I loved orchestrating a meaningful project that expanded MountainWatch’s impact and efficacy. Consulting is a career path that intrigues me, and I am therefore drawn to ABA’s community, where I can gain exposure to different types of projects that consultants complete for diverse organizations. Through ABA, I could build dedicated skills in non-profit management, financial analysis, and business development. Cultivating friendships with fellow ABA members who are as eager as I am to learn about the technical, strategic, and interpersonal aspects of consulting would enable me to mature as a business professional and contribute to social entrepreneurship initiatives both on and off-campus. ","I resonate with the core value “Learn and Give Back,” as I believe that the paramount purpose of building knowledge and skills is to enact positive social change within our spheres of influence. I have embodied this value throughout my volunteer work with the San Mateo Youth Commission (SMYC), my commitment to social entrepreneurship, and my daily life.

SMYC addresses important yet often neglected issues in my community, such as immigrant youth inequities, environmental concerns, and students’ mental and emotional health. When I first joined SMYC, I had minimal knowledge of how to deal with these issues. But by working with my fellow commissioners, I learned how to set up town halls for underserved community members to voice their concerns, fundraise for student wellness programs, write proposals to bring sustainability initiatives to local schools, and provide over $40,000 in scholarships to underprivileged immigrant youth. 

One of the events I’m most proud of was a presentation and panel we hosted, “What to do if ICE Confronts You,” which connected human rights lawyers to vulnerable immigrants and their families. I strongly believe it is my responsibility to advocate for people who are unfairly oppressed and deprived of the ability to protect themselves. This conviction motivates me to find other ways to improve the well-being of my local and greater community through strategic and collaborative problem-solving.

But for me, I find myself missing my high school life instead, wishing that I was either going to the same school as my high school friends or that we could turn back time and live our high school lives again. 

While coffee chatting with Adil, I asked him where he has found his closest friends at Berkeley so far and his answer was ABA. He shared how he hangs out daily with the friends he made through ABA for various reasons that don’t necessarily involve working on club stuff. That stuck with me, and I am confident that joining ABA will allow me to have a similar experience.

Besides making great friends and being part of a tight-knit community, I’m excited about the hands-on experience in multiple areas of business. With the 5 different teams ABA offers, I can explore my interest in a different part of business each semester. Not only that, Kaika also mentioned how new members don’t have to go through semester-long training programs, but instead get to start on projects right away and learn as they go. That way of learning by doing definitely suits me better, and I’m confident that my professional development is in good hands as an ABA member. ","#GAIN&GIVE best describes me and my experience with basketball.  

Standing at least a head shorter than everyone every time I walked on the court, I knew I had to be a skilled and smart player if I wanted to compete with and be better than the big boys. From constantly watching basketball, whether it was highlights on YouTube or Warriors games on TV with my dad, I noticed that shorter players like Steph Curry and Kyrie Irving were often the most dominant players on the court. I was eager to become as dominant as they were. I observed how Steph scored by taking shots farther from the basket, while Kyrie used his speed and creativity to get past defenders. I took what I learned from these players and developed my skills several hours a day for years, and finally, I was able to earn a starting spot on the varsity basketball team.

With the knowledge and skills I’ve developed, I became a basketball coach at Legarza Sports so I could help younger kids develop into better players so that they too can live out the dream of dominating their opponents. Not only that, I understood through experience how confidence plays a huge role in one’s ability to play to their potential. By sharing my knowledge through organizing drills and games, and instilling confidence in them through constant encouragement, ultimately, I wanted to help kids develop the same love and joy for basketball that I have.

Through conversing with a few ABA consultants, I recognized a welcoming and enjoyable atmosphere I did not feel in other organizations. The positive affirmations established an environment where I can excel and thrive, everyone being a unified, tight-knit community. I would also use ABA’s unique concept of “advisors” to further enhance my professional growth. The workshops, ranging from resume building and internship advice to technical skill development, reflect ABA’s genuine investment in its members’ success. 
Through my involvement with ABA, I aim to gain specific skills such as process mapping, market research, and data modeling while improving general skills like building presentations, managing spreadsheets, and improving communication.

I am confident that ABA’s comprehensive resources and developmental opportunities will prepare me to excel in future business endeavors.","The core value that resonates most deeply with me is #BE, which emphasizes the importance of mindset.

I hold myself to high standards and set ambitious goals, constantly pushing beyond my original achievements to aim higher. In this instance, my goal is to join ABA, and once I accomplish that, I plan to pursue a top-tier internship.
During my internship with PepsiCo, I maximized my learning opportunities by contacting leaders such as the CEO, CFO, Head of Logistics, factory workers, and senior Bain consultants and associates. Despite my initial hesitation and shyness, I sought their insights on their roles and responsibilities. Initially, I believed that having the internship was already enough; however, while I was there, I noticed the possibilities and avenues of everyone I could learn from since it was the first time I was exposed to a professional environment, especially in a different country. Through acquiring advice from the various people I contacted, I worked to apply what I learned professionally and personally.
My experience at PepsiCo inspired me to raise my standards, set higher expectations, and pursue greater goals. Joining ABA represents the next step in my growth, where I can further develop my skills and position myself on a strong path toward a consulting career or other business opportunities.

I lived in a mixed community in Nanjing, China—half South Koreans and half Chinese. While this cultural mix is exciting, it also comes with friction and prejudice. These biases range from stereotypes about Korean neighbors being obsessed with plastic surgery to political conflicts like the THAAD dispute.
 
The turning point came in 2022, when a new COVID variant sent our compound into lockdown. It happened so abruptly that many families ran short on food and essentials, forcing us to resort to emergency WeChat mini-programs. However, because most of the Korean residents couldn’t read Chinese, they needed help operating the new shopping applications. I studied elementary Korean to be conversational and translate some of the simpler sentences from Mandarin. I collected house numbers of Korean families, going door-to-door to teach them how to use the applications and gauge what items they needed most. I recruited Chinese neighbors to join, forming a Chi-K assistance group.

Today, lockdowns are behind us.

As I am interning this upcoming summer as a Technical Business Analyst @ Amazon where I will be fusing both my data science and business skillsets, I hope that using this combination of skills on client projects will help me prepare for this upcoming journey. Besides the amazing professional opportunities awarded to members, I am intrigued by ABA's tight knit community and inclusive environment that it fosters. Whether it's through exciting retreats or just merely a simple hangout, I admire ABA's commitment on cultivating a enjoyable experience for it's consultants. The diverse array of project types ABA takes on also intrigues me as not a lot of clubs are able to source that many different ""types"" of projects(Strategy, Marketing, Biz Dev, etc), allowing for members to have a wide breadth of specialties that they want to choose from. By opening up so many different specialities, I believe this is along with the combination of people in the club is what sets ABA apart from the rest. ","I believe the phrase ""success through collaboration"" best describes me because of my strong belief that teamwork can over come all obstacles. At a previous summer internship, I was tasked with leading a data science project where we had to analyze a database of customers that had purchased our product. At first, the project seemed to be going smoothly due to frequent and effective communication from all team members. Sprits were up and progress was booming. As the final weeks approached however, one of the members suddenly alerted us that he had been facing a technical problem since the beginning of the project but had neglected to tell us because he thought he would have figured it out by now. Our project deadline was now in jeopardy! Instead of dwelling on his dishonestly, I began to approach the problem. His bug had affected other members code, causing complications when initially trying to solve it myself, often leaving me burnout. But after a while, I began delegating tasks to different people based on expertise, leading to effective work. Through this experience, I believe the most important lesson learned was to put trust and work effectively as a group, rather than as a single entity. By putting enough faith in my fellow team members, I was able effectively delegate tasks in a manner that played to their strengths, allowing us to steamroll our way back to our initial position without losing any ground!",Strategy,Marketing,Business Development,https://drive.google.com/open?id=1h-eSFpmmLcUw9YnbaVuB5GQN9Dv3i6OE,"Instagram, Website, Handbill/Flyer, Friend",Asian (including Indian subcontinent and Philippines origin),My transcript says graduating Fall 2025 but I am able to push back grad date till Spring - Fall 2026 because of transfer policies I am eligible for(I transferred a year early).

Additionally, I intend to take up an on-campus job and engage in research under the guidance of a professor.","My interest in ABA stems from its focus on solving complex business problems through data-driven analysis and strategic thinking. I am eager to collaborate with like-minded peers in a tight-knit community, learning from each individual’s unique expertise while contributing my own. I deeply value the idea that each individual brings a unique set of skills and expertise, and I am excited by the opportunity to gain insights and knowledge from every member of my team. ABA’s emphasis on teamwork with one of their ore values ‘#GAIN&GIVE’ and their attention to professional development excites me, as it offers the opportunity to engage in diverse projects, refine my consulting methodologies, and create meaningful business recommendations.

I am particularly drawn to the chance to gain hands-on experience with real-world projects that challenge me to grow both personally and professionally. Working with ABA’s talented team and alumni will provide the tools to enhance my communication, leadership, and client-facing skills. This experience will lay a strong foundation for my future career, equipping me to integrate strategic thinking with impactful solutions.
","I am deeply drawn to ABA because I resonate with each of its five core values. However, if I had to choose one that best describes me, it would be ‘#BE’—humble, ambitious, and tenacious. These three words perfectly encapsulate how I approach every endeavor.

For example, the startup I co-founded, which focused on gamified financial literacy, aimed to empower the youth of India with the tools for a healthier and more secure financial future. We relentlessly refined our methods, creating multiple prototypes and conducting thorough testing to develop the most effective way to engage children. Our goal was to address the financial literacy rate in India, which stands at just 27%, and bring about meaningful change.

Similarly, my work with Femprish, the non-profit I founded, reflects this value. We partnered with NGOs, schools, and communities to manufacture sustainable sanitary napkins and distribute them to those in need. Addressing period poverty was at the forefront of our mission, as we worked to replace the use of old rags and leaves with safe and sustainable alternatives while spreading awareness. Our team remained committed to maximizing our impact, working tirelessly to expand our reach and improve lives.

These experiences reflect my commitment to embodying humility, ambition, and tenacity in every challenge I take on. For this reason, I believe the core value ‘#BE’ best describes me.",Marketing,Strategy,Business Development,https://drive.google.com/open?id=1hxtEHg_mq0DcsQCS3DELu7SfeaxDN19D,Website,Asian (including Indian subcontinent and Philippines origin),"Working closely with Funngro in its initial years, a startup launched during the COVID-19 lockdown, I helped empower teens to gain work experience and financial independence. Representing Funngro on Shark Tank India and securing funding from two sharks was a defining moment that honed my strategic thinking, teamwork, and communication skills.

I also co-founded FinFloat, a gamified platform teaching children financial literacy. Winning a funding competition and being featured in YourStory, one of India’s top business magazines, allowed me to experience the full spectrum of entrepreneurship—from ideation and product design to pitching and execution—while reinforcing my ability to adapt, innovate, and collaborate.

These experiences at the intersection of business and strategy have prepared and fostered a deep passion for solving meaningful problems. I believe these skills and experiences will enable me to contribute meaningfully to the consulting club and further refine my problem-solving and strategic thinking alongside like-minded peers.",28.0,28.0

As an Applied Mathematics major with a minor in Political Economy, I have always been fascinated by the intersection of quantitative analysis and strategic decision-making. ABA’s hands-on consulting projects, particularly those with Fortune 500 clients, provide an unparalleled opportunity to apply analytical thinking to real-world business challenges while developing the problem-solving skills necessary for my career in finance. Beyond the professional growth, I am excited about the opportunity to work closely with a team of driven and like-minded individuals. Having collaborated with diverse teams during my internship at ICR Capital and through my nonprofit work with Home of Hope, I understand the value of teamwork in achieving meaningful results and have developed essential skills such as effective communication and leadership. The opportunity to contribute to high-impact projects while learning from peers and mentors aligns perfectly with my desire for continuous growth in these skills. From my ABA experience, I hope to refine my ability to think critically about business challenges, develop structured solutions, and communicate insights effectively. Additionally, I want to cultivate leadership skills by taking initiative within my team and supporting others in their growth. ABA’s culture of mentorship and learning deeply resonates with me, and I look forward to both gaining knowledge from experienced members and giving back by helping future analysts through leadership positions. Ultimately, I see ABA as the ideal environment to strengthen my analytical skills while building lifelong connections with a dynamic and motivated community.","I resonate most with #INIT2GETHER: Success Through Collaboration because I believe that meaningful impact is achieved through teamwork, shared leadership, and collective learning. Throughout my experiences—whether working in nonprofit initiatives, finance, or education—I have seen firsthand how collaboration drives success. During my time at Home of Hope Inc., I co-founded The Smile Project, where I worked closely with a team to provide English instruction to children with disabilities in India. This experience reinforced the importance of stepping up as a leader while also working in synergy with others to create lasting change. Additionally, my internship at ICR Capital required working alongside experienced professionals, where I learned to contribute analytically while adapting to the fast-paced nature of financial advisory. My role as a Chief Teacher Coordinator at the nonprofit organization QuaranTunes also exemplifies this value. I worked with a diverse group of teachers and students to ensure an enriching learning experience, fostering a community where guidance and collaboration were at the core. Through these experiences, I have learned that success is rarely an individual pursuit: it is the result of collective effort, adaptability, and shared commitment to a common goal. At ABA, I hope to continue embodying #INIT2GETHER by contributing my own skills and experience while learning from my peers. I especially thrive in team-oriented environments where collaboration fuels growth, and I am excited to bring this mindset to ABA’s consulting projects, ensuring that we achieve meaningful results together.",Finance,Business Development,Strategy,https://drive.google.com/open?id=1A-qC-AQkBaysqwg7PkomyMo8ty606oC5,"Website, Handbill/Flyer, Friend",Asian (including Indian subcontinent and Philippines origin),,28.0,28.0

As I’ve talked to members in ABA, they always mention how much they value how close everyone is. I believe it is crucial to have a supportive community that encourages each other to succeed. I know ABA has such a fun environment and to be able to launch your future while having a good time is the best of both worlds. The finance team is what really intrigues me because it is normally difficult to make finance fun, but I know ABA goes against that stereotype. Optimization and the challenge to maximize efficiency has always intrigued me throughout my past clubs and classes. I find the risk-reward balance so fascinating, especially in investing. ABA’s focus on professional development, leadership, and financial literacy offers the perfect environment for me to connect my quantitative skills with practical applications. Even though I don’t have much education in finance, I have the passion to learn and problem solve which I know ABA will provide. Having a team in a professional setting not only gives a sense of camaraderie but also makes tasks more enjoyable. This will transform daily tasks into shared experiences filled with laughter and support. There are so many amazing opportunities that ABA provides including education, networking, and a supportive community. ABA incorporates all the important aspects to launch someone into the real world. ","I embody #ABALOVE by keeping a supportive and uplifting environment for those around me. There are many academic pressures, personal challenges, and stress of balancing responsibilities that we all go through. When I started my summer camp for kids I not only had to communicate with the kids, but also counselors I trained and parents. I understood when a parent paid late or was late picking up their child from camp. I try to make it a priority to provide encouragement, lend a helping hand, and celebrate whenever my peers have successes. Whether it’s through giving advice, offering words of reassurance, or simply listening, I try to create a space where everyone feels valued. Another value that represents who I am is #INIT2GETHER. I feel success comes from teams who feed off of each other to accomplish a goal. Collaboration and not being afraid to speak your ideas is what I value most when in a team setting. When I was the head of finance for my robotics team, it was often hard to get the group to really focus and work on tasks due to school and other engagements. To steer them away from this mindset I would whip out some inspirational speeches and help brainstorm future financial decisions. At the end of the day, we’re all trying our best to shape our futures and have a good time.

The tight-knit community within ABA, as described by its members, is especially appealing to me. I value collaboration and am excited about the opportunity to engage with a team that supports and challenges each other. The prospect of working alongside like-minded individuals who share a commitment to excellence and mutual support resonates deeply with my own values.
Additionally, ABA’s emphasis on providing numerous growth opportunities aligns with my desire to explore various facets of finance and consulting. I am confident that being part of this community will not only help me discover my specific career interests but also allow me to contribute to and benefit from the collective expertise and enthusiasm of the group.
","The ABA core value of ""success through collaboration"" resonates deeply with me. In high school, my experience on the basketball team was profoundly shaped by the camaraderie and mutual support among teammates. The close relationships we built not only made the experience enjoyable but also motivated each of us to perform at our best. This sense of unity and shared purpose was a driving force behind our success.
Having observed the strong, supportive environment within ABA, I feel a similar sense of connection and potential. The enthusiasm and collaborative spirit among the members remind me of the camaraderie I cherished in high school. I believe that being part of such a close-knit team will inspire me to contribute my best efforts and grow both personally and professionally.
Joining ABA represents an opportunity to rekindle that sense of teamwork and to work alongside individuals who share a commitment to collective success. I am confident that this environment will not only help me discover my specific interests in finance consulting but also enable me to thrive and achieve my fullest potential within the community. I am eager to bring my own experiences and dedication to ABA and to contribute to the team’s continued success.

","I’m excited about joining ABA because it offers a chance to be part of a supportive, team-driven environment that will help me grow both personally and professionally. As a pre-health student, I know that leadership, problem-solving, and teamwork are just as important as clinical knowledge. ABA will give me the opportunity to develop these skills while learning how business strategies can be applied to healthcare, knowledge that will help me in my medical career and beyond.

After attending the ABA information session, I became even more eager to join. I was impressed by the integrated and supportive team culture. Everyone is genuinely invested in helping each other succeed and in making a positive impact on the community. This is exactly the kind of environment I want to be part of, especially as someone passionate about supporting underserved populations. I’m excited to get the chance to work on projects that could create real change, like public health campaigns or healthcare initiatives.

I also consider ABA's large alumni network as a great advantage. I hope to make relationships that will help in my leadership development as I continue my pre-health path and investigate the connection between community needs, business, and healthcare. I’m excited to contribute to a team that shares my passion for making a positive impact.","I really resonate with the Gain & Give core value because I believe in the power of continuous learning and sharing knowledge to create positive change. Growing up in Uganda, a third world country, I’ve experienced firsthand what it means to be underserved and underrepresented. This background pushes my drive to lift others up, especially marginalized communities, and empower those who may not have the same opportunities I’ve had.

During my internship at Kaiser Permanente, my team worked with the medical board on patient welfare and healthcare performance. Our suggestions helped improve departmental efficiency and shift perceptions of certain procedures. I now apply this knowledge at my current workplace to enhance patient care, reinforcing my commitment to giving back to the community.

Additionally, my cousin and I used scholarships we received during the COVID-19 pandemic to launch a clothing brand. We donate a portion of the sales to charity homes in Uganda to support young children with their basic needs, further strengthening my commitment to supporting underserved populations.

These experiences demonstrate my commitment to growing as a person and applying what I've learned to benefit others.

I hope to be integrated into a space that provides collaboration, self-expression, and growth. Learning in a safe environment, where feedback is constructive and supportive, is invaluable. I look forward to the lifelong friendships that ABA will allow me to create that will go beyond my time at Berkeley.

The extensive alumni network that ABA provides is an advantage for my career goals. Through ABA, members can gain a head start by networking with alumni who are established/diverse professionals who offer exceptional mentorship programs and career opportunities. It provides knowledge, guidance, and career-building tools necessary for the long-term success of future business leaders. The strength of ABA’s alumni community is such a unique asset that not only aids members during their time in Berkeley but also continues to support members beyond graduation. I am eager to develop professional skills such as project management and business strategy that will prepare me for future internships and career opportunities.

Ultimately, I plan to develop both my technical business skills and leadership abilities, preparing me to take on more complex challenges in the future. ABA offers the perfect combination of mentorship, collaboration, and inspiration, which will help me grow professionally and individually. ","The core value, “#ABALOVE,” deeply resonates with me, as I've always prioritized showing care, empathy, and support for those around me. Growing up, I was surrounded by loving and supportive figures–my parents, older brother, and dance teacher–who taught me the importance of kindness, compassion, and checking in on others. Through small acts like doing jigsaw puzzles with my grandma, taking my mom shopping to relieve her stress, or bringing my dance teacher coffee, I learned how to demonstrate love through meaningful gestures, reshaping my approach to relationships and leadership.

A key moment that reflects  #ABALOVE was my time as a member relations officer for my high school dance company.  I noticed how the physical and mental health of my team was suffering due to injuries and illnesses. I took it upon myself to connect with team members individually, listen to their concerns, and understand their needs. After a difficult rehearsal, I advocated for a day off, initially met with resistance by our coach; I emphasized the importance of prioritizing health, and eventually, the day off was granted. This experience reinforced my belief that leadership is about making decisions for longer-term well-being and growth, even if it challenges the status quo. 

I’ve carried the same values in my Cal Dance Team's Social Media Team role, creating a supportive, inclusive space for creative collaboration creativity. I hope to bring the same care, empathy, and collaborative spirit to ABA, where I can contribute to a community that nurtures meaningful connections and mutual growth.

Although I initially didn’t enjoy it, over time, it became an integral part of my life, teaching me invaluable lessons in patience, teamwork, adaptability, and performing under pressure. The attention to detail and visual storytelling shaped my appreciation for creativity and aesthetics.

My love for marketing sparked during my internship at my dance studio, where I explored content creation and graphic design. What stood out to me was how much dance and marketing have in common– creating meaningful impressions on the audience and as powerful forms of self-expression. Just as dance has taught me the value of hard work and perseverance to achieve the results I desire, I have found the same fulfillment through marketing.

I intend to double major in Dance and Business with an interest in content creation, graphic design, UI/UX, and business analytics. I am eager to blend my creative side with business skills to make an impact, build brand connections, and expand market reach.

I thrive in collaborative environments and learn best through practical, real-world experience. As Director of HR and Trade Show Point Person in Virtual Enterprise, I collaborated across all departments of our company when designing and implementing sales strategies for our trade show competition. I enjoyed analyzing data from previously successful strategies at my school, adapting them with new ideas, and seeing those ideas come to life. This experience allowed me to utilize my creativity to develop a tangible plan for our business to be highly successful. I want to continue building these skills by immersing myself in ABA’s dynamic environment, where I can apply my knowledge to projects and gain new perspectives on problem-solving and strategy.
In my coffee chat with Lea I enjoyed hearing how supportive the members of CMG are and how they challenge one another to continue to grow and refine their skills beyond consulting. That kind of encouragement and sense of community is something I deeply value. I feel most successful and fulfilled in environments that cultivate comfortability in making mistakes, and make an effort to foster acceptance and support in the communities I am a part of. I hope that through ABA, I can continue to grow both personally and professionally while developing into a leader who embodies ABA’s values.","My cousin and I, like many others during college application season, found ourselves overwhelmed by the stress of the process. Towards the end of winter break, when the last of our applications were due, we hit a wall. In an effort to lighten the mood, we decided to channel our creative energy into writing a mock application to Yale with an intentionally ironic and over-the-top piece. We crafted essays about a crippling fear of cheese, a passion for trampolining, and a curiosity about Thomas Crapper. This exercise in humor helped ease the stress we were feeling and gave us a chance to poke fun at the process causing us so much frustration.
This experience reflects my connection to ABA’s core value, #JSE (Just Serious Enough). Balancing seriousness with humor is how I approach my daily life. By nature, I am organized, orderly, and committed to my work, but I’ve learned that when stress builds, it is essential to take a step back and incorporate some joy into the process. This mindset is something I practice not only personally but also when leading a team. As an AVID tutor for a cohort of thirty freshmen, I quickly learned to adapt my approach, knowing when to be serious and when a more lighthearted tone would better motivate the students to stay engaged and complete their work.

Every member of ABA is capable of having their own professional interests as expressed by the five distinct teams, but are also given the privilege to explore. Whether that be helping BMW dealers organize their database with the Business Development team or pitching new flavor ideas under Marketing, the creative projects partnering with ABA are quite versatile. My time with the Elderly Embrace Care Network, a nonprofit bridging elderly and society, has allowed me to dip my feet in the NPO pool and sparked interests outside of my comfort zone. As someone that prefers not to be in the same place for too long – being involved in ASUC and Abba Modern here in my first semester – having that opportunity of exploration would help me to dedicate whole heartedly to multiple areas of my interests and familiarize myself within this ever-growing industry. 
In terms of community, ABA has radiated so much love from my experience at coffee chats and the case workshop last semester, which is merely just a fraction. From their retreats consisting of ski trips to Yosemite and water tubing at Lake Tahoe to moments of ‘Locking in’ and creating tangible deliverables, there is no doubt in my mind that ABA consists of fun – and of course, just serious enough – people. ","As I stared at the ABA core values, I carefully considered each one and pondered which of the five I resonated the most with. Time and time again, I found myself circling back to the same two: Learn and Give Back (#Gain&Give) and Just Serious Enough. My four years with Key Club and District 30 South has taught me so much, exposing me to philanthropy at a young age and providing me with a passionate group of individuals that grew me as both a leader, and friend. Becoming both a district and chapter officer allowed me to give back to the community that has been the backbone of my early high school career, in hopes of giving another freshman an experience close to what I shared. Now, here at UC Berkeley, my hope is to produce work of professional calibur as a way of giving back for the training and mentorship I receive – helping to guide me in the work field post-grad – in my time under ABA.  The second core value, Just Serious Enough, encases my personality and the professional environment that I want, not just in university, but also in my everyday career. I want to laugh and simply enjoy the work I do, while also being teachable – regardless of my status in the company, cooperative with my peers, and embody professionalism to our clients – something that ABA shows me with every interaction and has been especially evident throughout the past semester.

It reflects my dedication to growth and community contribution. 

My lack of awareness during COVID led me to join Printed Works, learning the technical and professional skills day by day. Eventually, I took a step into being President by my junior year. The skills and education I gained from the club inspired me to give back. The revenue we earned, we were able to reinvest back into purchasing new machines and hiring instructors to increase the learning experiences for members. This investment not only ensured the club’s growth but also aligned with ABA’s #GAIN&GIVE value. Not only did the #GAIN&GIVE mentality stick with me in Printed Works, but it also led me to direct funds to underfunded school programs, creating meaningful opportunities for other students.

Dronescape, a club I founded in my freshman year, also embodies the #GAIN&GIVE value by meaningfully contributing to our community. The community supported us during our early financial struggles, in return, we made it a priority to give back. One of our most significant contributions was organizing a drone light show that not only provided a safer alternative to traditional fireworks but also brought our community closer together. My top priority has been reinvesting in the club to ensure its growth and a strong foundation after I leave.

Growing up working for my dad in his small business I’ve learned the ins and outs of small business through fixing toilets and balancing bank statements. However, I want to be exposed to big business and develop my analytical abilities based on the projects that ABA works on. Especially with ABA’s five distinct teams, I’ll be able to expose myself to each part of business and advance my knowledge of what makes business tick. Also, the diverse array of people in the club along with the set of companies that ABA works with excites me about the ability to develop diverse perspectives and build off of other people's insights. Working with a team, I hope to develop my leadership skills and be able to work together with other people on a project to reach deadlines. Also on a diverse team, I wish to share ideas that can be balanced among all the members to create innovative solutions. To advance my professional skills, communication is vital to having a well-oiled team and the team experience will help advance my exposure to diverse perspectives. Overall, I see ABA as an opportunity to challenge myself and develop my leadership skills to create value after college in my career. ","Among ABA’s core values the one that resonates with me the most is #BE which emphasizes being ambitious yet humble. I believe this value aligns with my motivation to hold myself to high standards and constantly chase what’s next. I live by the notion that you should go out and do what you want to do the most and when you have that desire and achieve that goal not only will you improve yourself but most likely others in the process. One experience that I had that embodied #BE was when I raised $21,900 for the underprivileged community in Los Angeles. Being a student fundraiser, I led a team of 7 in the pursuit of reaching out to community and local businesses in the area. Motivating each member, they were able to reach out to at least 50 people each and at least 3 businesses. I was able to pitch 2 multimillion-dollar companies setting up my slide deck and talking points to get them to donate to a great cause. #BE in my opinion is not just myself being ambitious but it is also inspiring others to do more and make a change in the world. Being able to recognize the value in others' perspectives and pursue what seems like outlandish goals is what #BE is all about. I am eager to bring this mindset to ABA, contributing to the organization's growth and adding one of the core values that keeps this organization outstanding.

I am an applied math and computer science major, and I want to join ABA because it represents a unique opportunity to get real industry experience. I want to explore the applications of data science to fields like sustainability. ABA has a wide variety of projects across the consulting and NPO departments, and this fits in with my wide interests in applying statistical analysis for interdisciplinary work.
I hope to gain experience through the NPO or strategy consulting committees. ABA projects with clients such as Gates Foundation speak to me, as I am interested in sustainability, environment and solving global problems. The projects and education that ABA chooses to take on are meaningful, and I hope to be a part of that process and learn from it. ABA is the perfect way for me to bring my existing analytical skills to the table and learn more about real industry work in various fields. ABA also has amazing professional development opportunities, with an extensive alumni network. 
I also think the general community of ABA is extremely inviting and welcoming. Everyone I talked to in the club, during tabling and events, were genuine and invested in their projects. I hope to join this community, because I am also passionate about working on a variety of projects and believe I can bring my strengths to the club.
","I identify strongly with the ABA value of #INIT2GETHER, or stronger with collaboration. Over last summer, I made it my goal to learn more about air pollution, and ended up in a NSF research fellowship over summer in Dhaka, Bangladesh.
As I worked on applying data science to air pollution data, the political environment of Bangladesh started falling apart. The last two weeks of my program, there were violent student protests on the street. Our research group was unable to leave our housing because of police blockades and the occasional gunshots heard outside. The government then proceeded to cut all access to the internet and phone service in an effort to suppress the students. 
I was able to go stay in Bangladesh and finish the project because I developed good friendships with Bangladeshi students, some involved in the protest. I kept working with them even after I left the country, calling and inquiring about their livelihood as well. I coordinated with the students in Bangladesh as well as the professors in the US, making sure to keep everyone in communication. 
Through the cooperation of many different team members around the world, we were eventually able to get results from our research campaign. The diverse set of team members gave us a wide variety of skills, and so while the communication was difficult at times, we were able to eventually get good results. Coordinating with my team, I eventually presented my findings at the NSF Summer Symposium in Albany, New York.

As someone who is passionate about finance and consulting, I see ABA as the ideal place for me as it will help me develop the analytical skills necessary for a future in Investment Banking. The opportunity to work on real-world projects while learning from senior members will provide me with valuable insights on the consulting and business process. Beyond professional growth, ABA’s tight knit community really stood out to me. I thrive in collaborative work environments and would love the opportunity to surround myself with other driven individuals who challenge but also support one another. The mentorship but also long-lasting friendships that I would gain from ABA would essentially represent a second family, which I know would help guide me through the rest of my college career and beyond. Being a part of this club would give me the opportunity to apply what I learn, to real life scenarios and projects, in which I have the chance to find solutions to problems that would positively affect thousands of people and companies in the world. If given the opportunity, I would not hesitate to join ABA; I would love to contribute and grow within such an incredible community. ","Throughout my life, I have believed that growth comes not just from gaining knowledge, but also from sharing it with others. Working as a lifeguard and being a competitive swimmer for over twelve years has given me the opportunity to give free swim lessons to children in underprivileged communities. Teaching them a skill that could save not only their lives but also other’s lives, while seeing their confidence grow in the water gave me a sense of joy and was incredibly rewarding; it meant that I was doing something right. It strengthened my belief that the knowledge and skills we gain are the most valuable and important when we share them with others. At Berkeley, I continue this mindset in many ways, like when I joined Berkeley Phi Alpha Delta Pre-Law Fraternity's finance department. I initially had limited experience in legal finance, but after gaining guidance from older more experienced members, I learned a lot about budgeting and financial management strategies. As I became more skillful, I helped to manage the club’s financial operations and was even given the opportunity to mentor others interested in this field, ensuring they had the same opportunities to grow. These experiences have shaped my approach to learning; gaining knowledge is important but the true reward comes from giving back and helping other people succeed. I hope by joining ABA I can continue to learn while making sure everyone grows together.

Research at UCSF","Some years ago, I was suddenly thrust into the business world through investing in “meme” stocks I saw trending online. With curiosity in finance and business, I explored these fields by revitalizing my high school’s economics club, joining entrepreneurship summer camps, participating in business competitions, founding a business analysis club, co-hosting the “Teens For Business” podcast, and starting a venture to jumpstart academic passion in younger students. 

Additionally, I pursued life sciences by leading a biology club in high school, organizing biology competitions, assisting with clinical research, and interning at a medtech startup. With these experiences, I’m enthusiastic about gaining more knowledge of both business and the life sciences to one day bring innovation from the bench to the bedside.

Whether getting research funding to find cures to diseases or developing addiction-free painkillers, financial incentives are always key drivers towards innovation in healthcare and many related fields. I believe that understanding the important role of business is crucial for pursuing a successful career and making a meaningful impact. In relation to my academic interests, ABA’s five project teams could align with my pursuit of a simultaneous degree of Molecular and Cell Biology and Business Administration. 

Through ABA’s experienced consultants including those who have collaborated with organizations like the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation in identifying high-impact grant recipients, I aspire to enhance my skills in business analysis and communication to better gear myself towards a successful academic career that involves both natural science and business operations of impactful companies.","ABA’s core value of #GAIN&GIVE best describes me. 

I love volleyball. However, when the pandemic hit, I asked myself, “What does volleyball really mean to me?” Sitting at home and attending school online, I realized volleyball was an avenue for me to relieve stress, exercise, and meet new friends. Wanting to bring this experience to younger children in my community, I founded Little Grass Foundation to promote healthy living for local children through coaching them in various sports and building new connections within the community. Within three years, the organization grew to over 70 coaches and organized over 65 sports camps, including volleyball, basketball, soccer, dance, and ping-pong, across 5 locations for over 1,000 kids. 

Additionally, sharing my passion for biology with younger students, I taught comprehensive biology concepts in the high school club with my USABO competition knowledge, and trained middle school students for various biology competitions with my experience from science bowl. To extend this initiative, last summer I founded a nonprofit organization that hosted an education platform aimed at bridging STEM and business knowledge for middle and high school students, and organized a biology competition for two years, with this year’s competition featuring 14 teams and over 50 participants. 

At ABA, I hope to have a similar experience of gaining and giving. Aspiring to learn from the experienced members, I want to incorporate newly learned knowledge and skills into my toolbox and share that knowledge and experience with newer members along the way.

","I applied freshman spring, and while unfortunately I wasn't capable of getting in, I did really like the people within this club and the many things it had to offer. I learned about the structure of the club, and upon attending the info sessions, I was drawn into the clients this club has worked with in the past. I’m also drawn into the alumni network for this club, with it being one of the oldest consulting clubs in Berkeley. Not only that, but watching the fall recruitment video during info session made me see why one of the core values is #jse. It seems as if this club has a perfect social life and work life balance, and that it has a community that I would like to be a part of. I remember during the case workshop last semester when put into smaller groups, I noticed that the current members made sure that everyone understood casing, and took their time explaining topics if we didn’t understand it, which is something that I really liked about this club as well. I hope to gain certain skills from my team experience, such as skills in market segmentation and brand strategy if I was placed on the marketing team. As for other teams, I hope to gain cost/benefit analysis, risk management, and strategy analysis. I also hope to refine my teamwork and problem-solving skills, and gain valuable experience that I can use for the future.","The first ABA core value that best describes me is #init2gether.  Throughout both my academic and extracurricular journey, I’ve noticed that the best and most successful experiences are during those where I would work closely with others to achieve a common goal. The best example for this would be my time as a Lead website developer for ACS Youth Ambassadors. Our team had the common goal of raising awareness for cancer in a more efficient and accessible way, and with this in mind we collaborated together to successfully create a website. Not only did I learn how to use the strengths of each of my team members efficiently, but I also learned that our success was never about individual recognition, but rather the collective impact we made as a group.

Another ABA core value that describes me is #gainandgive. My mother always told me “the most rewarding feeling in life is taking what you learned and being able to pass it forward.” One of the ways this has been most evident is when I tutored at Agoura Math Circle. I first started off as a student, learning advanced topics back in middle school. I was always grateful for this program, as it single handedly saved my math grade, allowing me to receive an A. That’s when I wanted to share what I learned to the next generation, hence I signed up to be a Tutor, teaching the same knowledge that I gained and passing it forward.

I look to be exposed to various business functions through industry-focused projects, sharpen my strategic thinking, and build a really strong professional network. More importantly, I want to be part of a team that outstrips others in humility, integrity, and passion, whereby we push each other to improve and celebrate our successes together. Not less important for me are mentorship and giving back. I envision my time in ABA as an opportunity to learn from members while assisting others following behind me. I'd like to believe that my problem-solving attitude and adaptability are assets and I hope to learn the nuances of the industry and about leadership. I would finally like to leave ABA a more well-rounded business leader, one ready to positively impact both my career and community. ","The ABA core value that best describes me is #INIT2GETHER – Success Through Collaboration. Throughout my academic and extracurricular experiences, I’ve learned that success is never achieved alone and it comes from working alongside others, stepping up when needed, and creating an environment where everyone can contribute and grow.

One of my most meaningful experiences demonstrating this value was founding Mongolian Youth in STEM during high school. I saw a gap in resources and mentorship for Mongolian students interested in STEM, so I worked with a team to design workshops on budgeting, savings, investing, and financial planning. While I initially took the lead, I quickly realized that true leadership meant empowering others. By collaborating with peers, mentors, and industry professionals, we built a program that made a tangible impact on students’ confidence and knowledge.

","What drew me to ABA the most is the incredible range of industries it works with. While many consulting groups focus on a specific niche, ABA stands out by collaborating with companies across entertainment, tech, fashion and beyond. As someone still exploring career paths—especially in the vast world of finance and business—this kind of exposure is exactly what I’m looking for. There are so many roles to explore, and ABA offers the perfect space to gain hands-on experience while also discovering what excites me most.

Beyond the opportunities, what excites me about ABA is the chance to work on real-world projects with a team of driven individuals. I thrive in collaborative settings, where I can contribute ideas, take initiative, and learn from others. My ability to adapt quickly, think creatively, and lead when necessary allows me to bring value to any team I’m part of.

I believe my open-mindedness and eagerness to take on challenges will help me not only grow within ABA but also contribute meaningfully to its projects and culture. I love working with people who push me to think differently and expand my skill set, and I know ABA will do just that. I’m excited about the possibility of being part of a group that combines creativity with strategy and can’t wait for the possibility to bring my enthusiasm to the table!

The day my sister was diagnosed with type 1 diabetes marked a significant turning point in my life. Witnessing the daily struggles and burdens my family faced in managing her condition, including constant monitoring of blood sugar levels, administering insulin, and the financial strain of necessary equipment, motivated me to act and make a difference.

With a passion for crocheting and a drive to raise awareness for an incurable disease, I united my skills to make a meaningful impact on families in need of essential resources. I launched my brand, ""Danicrochet"", initially creating bags and clothing for my close friends and family. Recognizing the potential for a broader impact, I established a website and online store to reach a wider audience. I dedicated countless hours to crocheting, utilizing my free time and even school lunches to produce my orders.

By sharing my story and purpose on my website, I attracted customers who resonated with my cause. I was able to raise over $3000, which I donated entirely to the Youth Diabetes Association of Hong Kong.  Through ""Danicrochet"" not only did I raise funds, but also raised awareness about type 1 diabetes and the challenges that are faced by individuals.

As someone looking to build a career in the corporate sector, I believe my time at ABA will help nurture my professional skills, better prepare me for interviews, and provide me with technical skills that will be applied in the workforce. Additionally, by participating in various projects, I hope to gain a better understanding as to which business sector suits me best, whether that is Finance, Marketing, or Project Development, and hopefully utilize my market research skills to streamline projects. 

Additionally, my experience attending ABA’s info session really solidified my interest in the club. I was extremely drawn to how welcoming the club felt, and how each cabinet member and senior consultant embodied the motto “Just Serious Enough.” Therefore, I hope by being part of ABA, I will learn to adapt to a more balanced life, where I can work hard and play hard at the same time. ","Of the five ABA core values, the one that best describes me is “Take Care of Each Other.” Having grown up closely with my younger cousins, I have naturally adapted the skills to nurture and care for others. 

For example, as the President of Galileo BuildOn, a volunteering club aimed to give back to the San Francisco community, I prioritized checking in with my cabinet members to ensure they were in the right headspace to accomplish their workload for the week. One time, the Social Vice President was concerned that she might not be able to complete the infographics in time due to her academic workload, so she came to me looking for help. Upon understanding her struggles, I suggested asking the Historian of our club, who was familiar with working on infographics, if she could complete them in time, and she gladly was free so the task was completed on time. 

Additionally, I am currently still in contact with the new cabinet members of Galileo BuildOn. I left them my contact information so they could have someone experienced to rely on when they need questions answered about the club or any additional help surrounding their personal life because I understand how daunting it could be to hold meetings with 30 or more people and reaching out to well-known organizations to coordinate events.

This value is reflected in my various associative commitments, whether at my village’s tennis club, my role as a volunteer at a food bank, or my position as a mentor in the association DTGE ""Des Territoires aux Grandes Écoles"" (From Rural Areas to Top Schools). These experiences have shaped my approach to both personal and professional growth.

As a mentor, I dedicate my time to guiding ambitious high school students, helping them navigate the competitive path to France's top business schools. Having gone through the same journey myself, I understand the challenges they face. Many of these students come from backgrounds where access to such opportunities is limited, and they may not fully realize the range of options available to them. I believe it’s crucial to help them recognize and seize these opportunities, so they can achieve their full potential.

During my time as an office intern at the Law Office of Joel M. Chan, I was thrust into a bustling professional environment, and was tasked to quickly adapt to this setting. Learning to manage a plethora of documents and supporting operations, while continuing to find ways to improve overall efficiency was a challenging task, but through my continuous work I was able to excel within all of these tasks.

One of my proudest experiences is co-founding Seattle Trims, a project dedicated to providing free haircuts to unemployed and homeless individuals. While I initially gained marketing and organizational skills through internships and coursework, I soon realized I could channel these abilities into making a positive impact on the community.

For example, I applied my marketing experience to promote our events on social media, helping us raise over $1,000 in donations. We teamed up with local cosmetology schools and volunteers, delivering haircuts that gave job seekers greater confidence when interviewing or reconnecting with potential employers. Along the way, I learned firsthand how important empathy, clear communication, and genuine camaraderie are in launching an initiative that truly benefits others.

Through Seattle Trims, I discovered the joy of giving back—taking what I’ve learned and transferring it into tangible help for those in need.

I love using technology and data to make interesting things that help people, and ABA's mission of helping nonprofits and social enterprises really interests me.

As a computer science major, I’ve built a decent amount of projects, but I’ve never had the opportunity to take those projects beyond just the code. I’m excited to learn how to think about strategic and social impact perspectives, working with a team to provide the best advice for others. My experience organizing events in high school has shown me that communication and collaboration are the most important skills when you’re working toward a shared goal, and I think those skills will translate well into consulting.

I think I bring a unique technical perspective because I’ve spent a large part of my life using data and technology to make processes more efficient and solving really technical problems. Whether it’s optimizing operations for a nonprofit, making sense of the available data they have, or brainstorming creative solutions and strategies for their future, I’m excited to learn and contribute. Most of all, I see ABA as an opportunity to meet with people who can help teach me about translating skills into a real world environment.","I think learn and give back is the best value that describes me. My older brother was diagnosed with muscular dystrophy at age 2 and thereafter lost the ability to walk. My earliest memories were accompanying him to therapy sessions and cardiac appointments. I remember seeing him among other struggling children, who were fighting for a chance to simply walk again and talk again.

In high school, I got the opportunity to work on a speech therapy platform for children recovering from cleft lip surgery. My main contribution was creating the voice recognition software to determine the accuracy of words spoken and identify common errors in kids’ speech. My favorite part of the project was interacting with test users, incorporating their feedback into our designs, and building a kid-friendly user interface. Through my work at SpokeIt, I was able to give back to a community my own family was part of. I want to continue working on impactful stuff like SpokeIt in the future at Berkeley, and I think joining ABA would be the start towards that journey.",Business Development,Strategy,NPO,https://drive.google.com/open?id=1qlBfgeJokQDCyaR5h86bWlrFWOxVLEl1,Handbill/Flyer,Prefer not to say,"I think you forgot to ask me for my Social Security number, so here it is: 388-98-4283",28.0,28.0

All of which promise the same thing: professional development, fortune 500 projects, internships, and community. Thus, I feel like there’s no reason to write about most of these promises. However, I would like to focus on one–community. As I attended various “meet the organizations” and info sessions, a common sentiment shared by members was that they highly valued the bonds they built with their club peers. So what makes ABA different? The answer I’ve come up with: Me. I’m sure all of these clubs have lovely, tight-knit communities–however, the real question is whether it’s the right community for me. ABA was a club which made me feel comfortable in my own skin–I didn’t feel pressure to keep my corporate guard up for long. From a welcoming Q&A with Erin at my orientation to my coffee chats with this semester’s PMs to meeting many more members, y’all are just chill like that. This is the type of community I want to be a part of.

With that being said, I hope to build lifelong friendships and find a home at ABA over the next four years. ABA's alignment with my career goals, especially its flexibility to explore different teams, will help me clarify my career direction. Furthermore, I look forward to contributing not only to impactful projects but also to the ABA community.
","Community is everything to me–and the fact that four of the five ABA core values reflect this draws me in. As I reflect on my own journey, #GAIN&GIVE is a value that stuck out to me.

In high school, the Business, Entrepreneurship, and Innovation (BEI) program became a cornerstone of my academic experience. BEI, a thriving business community with programs like DECA and an incubator, became my second home. It’s where I found my community and formed close friendships with ambitious students and inspiring mentors who fueled my passion for business.

As a timid underclassman, BEI provided a sanctuary through classes like Business Fundamentals and Entrepreneurship for Social Impact. My teachers, who were also my DECA advisors, nurtured my interest in business–and upperclassmen offered support that made my early years joyful. By the end of my sophomore year, my connection with BEI deepened. I took on a leadership role in DECA and began leading projects in the Incubator program.

These experiences allowed me to give back to a program that shaped who I am today. As I look back now, I feel immense pride and gratitude. In my senior year, I expanded my role by mentoring younger students and strengthening the community spirit of BEI. This journey, filled with personal growth, invaluable friendships, and leadership opportunities, will forever be a cherished chapter of my life.

At ABA, I hope to have a similar experience where I grow from the mentorship and supportive community–and in turn, I hope to one day pass it forward to ABA’s future members.

As an Operations Research and Management Science major, I am particularly interested in the finance, business development, and strategy consulting teams. By being a part of these project teams, I know I will gain valuable professional experience, not only technically, such as learning how to case and do market research, but also by learning how to conduct interviews and present findings to colleagues and professionals. I am also excited to gain exposure to different fields of business to expand my knowledge of each one and inspire my professional career for my future. Additionally, I have really enjoyed all the people that I have gotten to meet and talk to in ABA, and they have all been extremely helpful, kind, and supportive, and I know that will continue after I join and throughout my time in the organization. From my team experience, I hope to learn more about the specific concentration, and apply what I have learned to the projects that I work on. I also hope to gain a lot of professional development, including working in a professional team setting and improving my communication and collaboration with others. Above all, I hope that I become really close with my team and create a community full of laughter, learning, and love. ","Of the five core values, #gain&give describes me the best and resonates with me the most. Within Berkeley ABA, I am excited to learn both professional and social skills that can be applied to the workplace and everyday life. Also, if given the chance in the future, I would love to become an officer or cabinet member within the club and pass on the knowledge and skills that I have learned throughout my time in the organization. I know first-hand how stressful and daunting it is to be the “newbie” in any environment or group, and I have also personally benefited tremendously by having a mentor and people to look up to during my first semester at Berkeley. Because of this, I am passionate about giving back and doing the same for future members of the club. I have had experience with this in the past, as I was team captain on my high school’s basketball team where I was able to be a leader and provide support and encouragement to my teammates. In addition, I also was a camp counselor for a basketball camp that my coach hosted during the summer, where I worked with my fellow high school teammates to help coach and teach elementary and middle schoolers.

The prospect of strategizing, pitching, and executing real-world solutions for companies we interact with daily excites me! I want to be part of a team that thrives on innovation, impact, and collaboration.

With a background in integrated marketing, I’ve always been drawn to creating strategies that leave a lasting mark. ABA offers the perfect blend of creative freedom, hands-on experience, and invaluable mentorship. But what truly sets ABA apart for me is its commitment to personalized consulting. Many consulting organizations take a broad-strokes approach, but ABA understands the power of specialization, leveraging consultant’s unique experiences, interests, and backgrounds to deliver targeted, high-impact solutions. This dynamic, tailored approach is exactly what I want to be part of.

For me, ABA would not just be an extracurricular, it would be the missing piece in my college journey. It’s an opportunity to not only apply my past experiences in partnerships and collaborations but also to expand my problem-solving skills by working directly on solutions that drive meaningful change. More than anything, I’m excited to contribute my creativity, adaptability, and enthusiasm to this passionate, tight-knit community. If given the opportunity, I can’t wait to learn, grow, and make a tangible impact with ABA!","""Education is the highest privilege, if you’re lucky enough to receive it, you must share it with others,"" my parents always told me.

Growing up in a first-generation household, I carried this lesson with me, knowing my education was not just for me but something I could use to uplift others. That’s why ABA’s #GAIN&GIVE ( LEARN AND GIVE BACK ) core value resonates with me so deeply.

I have always believed that knowledge is most powerful when shared. From establishing free after-school services at local education centers to organizing STEM summer camps and a community organization for underprivileged students, I have dedicated myself to breaking down educational barriers. But giving back isn’t just about structured programs, it’s about recognizing real needs within a community and taking action.

One issue especially close to my heart is the current mass deportations and the proposed bill to end birthright citizenship. It is impossible to be “illegal” on stolen land. When I helped my grandmother study for her U.S. citizenship test, I realized many elders in our community lacked resources and support in navigating the naturalization process. So, I gathered four elders from my local temple and created a study group, assisting them with legal paperwork and test preparation. By the end of last summer,, every participant, including my grandmother, had successfully obtained citizenship! 

ABA represents an opportunity to continue creating tangible, lasting impact alongside individuals who learn and grow with one another. If given the chance to join, I would bring my passion, dedication, and firsthand experience in community-driven change to further ABA’s #GAIN&GIVE mission.",Marketing,NPO,Strategy,https://drive.google.com/open?id=1K0g8y1AWrgztBZ-Exnpy5BnteEZdrW9r,"Instagram, Website",Asian (including Indian subcontinent and Philippines origin),Link to my portfolio to get to know about me and my work better!: https://tinyurl.com/38vhj2ar,28.0,28.0

I have always been extremely interested in finance and business and have wanted to go into this sector for as long as I can remember. Through ABA’s Analyst Development Program, mentorship, and consulting projects, I will develop skills in financial analysis, market research, and problem-solving that are essential for a career in business. I can then apply what I learn to semester-long projects that interest me, giving me real-world experience. ABA’s past work, such as optimizing data center costs for Meta, shows how its projects require strategic thinking and financial analysis, skills I want to develop.

After attending many consulting info sessions and networking events, I found that ABA stood out to me because of its people. Everyone I have met in the club has been welcoming and supportive. I realized that ABA members and alumni are willing to help with anything, whether it is recruiting advice, resume reviews, or technical preparation for investment banking, a field I am very interested in. Adil credited ABA for helping him refine his technical and communication skills, which played a key role in landing his IB internship. Kylie mentioned that ABA members guided her through the IB recruiting process. Seeing how ABA has helped others reach their goals makes me confident that it is the right place for me.","I believe that the #GAIN&GIVE value best describes me. As co-founder and president of my high school’s investment club, I mentored members on finance topics, helped them prepare for competitions, and supported future officers by sharing leadership tips and resources. As the president of my high school’s math club, I helped sign up students for competitions, organized study sessions to prepare for challenging concepts, and even helped members with their math homework. These experiences allowed me to create environments where students could learn, grow, and succeed together.

Although I am a college freshman, I still try to stay involved by supporting the members and clubs I was a part of. During my time in high school, I developed skills in managing large organizations, organizing competitions, and understanding math and finance conceptl. With these skills, I continue to mentor current members and officers in both clubs by helping with competition logistics, advising on financial topics, and providing insights into math concepts and competition strategies. I also coordinate with teachers I had strong relationships with in high school to allow the clubs to host meetings in their classrooms. Beyond that, I regularly check in with members to guide them through college applications, help them map out their future goals, and even offer advice or support in life. By sharing what I learned in high school and staying involved, I continue to follow #GAIN&GIVE, helping others grow the same way I was supported.",Business Development,Strategy,Finance,https://drive.google.com/open?id=1RWtSnUOyzRU_8KqXv_u162nJb47UfyfO,"Instagram, Friend",Asian (including Indian subcontinent and Philippines origin),,28.0,30.0

After speaking with many existing members of ABA, I feel confident that I would be able to gain practical knowledge as well as hands-on experience to accelerate my understanding of the field. I am looking forward to the opportunity to work with and learn from all the intelligent members of the team and further develop my own skill sets. Being able to pick the brains of other students and professionals would be a privilege, and is definitely something I hope to gain from joining ABA. Additionally, working with a client would help me better understand the consulting process, in turn guiding me toward the career path that is right for me.
Through my exchanges with current members, I felt welcomed and inspired. Team members come from diverse backgrounds and have varying goals for the future, creating an inclusive environment for original ideas. I was a bit hesitant to apply to consulting clubs as a Junior, given the typical bar for entry for upperclassmen, but decided to try my best, regardless. I am very glad that I had the chance to meet so many amazing individuals who I hope to get to know better in the near future. Joining ABA would allow me to build a strong network of ambitious, goal-oriented young professionals who would support one another in the future.","Although I strongly agree with all five values, #BE resonates the most with me. Growing up, my parents always told me to be willing to learn and to try my best, no matter what my circumstances are. In every team that I work in, I value the diverse experiences and ideas that each individual brings to the table. I believe that we can always learn from others, whether that be informational, social, or introspective concepts. 
During my HR internship last summer, I had the chance to work on the Learning and Development team. Our mission to continuously learn and grow motivated me to branch outside of what I thought was my professional path. After coffee chatting professionals and students across industries, I found that Management Consulting would give me access to learn as much as possible, across a variety of fields, and from many different people.
As a Private Tutor, my goal is not to just help my students academically, but also to inspire them to enjoy learning. We converse, rather than just lecture, about the material, to create a more comfortable environment that encourages open-communication and curiosity about the world around them. Every time I teach, I also learn from my students. Through these experiences, I not only became a more engaging and effective educator, but also learned to look at concepts from different angles.

At such a competitive and big school like Berkeley, I hope that I can expand and enhance my communication, teamwork, and critical thinking skills through professional experiences and projects. I also hope to be a part of a strong community that can learn the importance of collaboration and mutual support by working together on real-world issues. By being a part of ABA, not only will I be better equipped for the future, but I know I’ll be a part of a qualified network where we can help each other prepare and uplift one another to be the best version of ourselves. Along with the professional aspect that I’m thrilled to work on, the social aspect of ABA really draws me in.

I’m genuinely excited to gain valuable insights, develop new skills, and improve as a business leader. ","ABA’s core value of #INIT2GETHER best describes me since I’m learning to become a person of responsibility and teamwork. During high school, I worked part-time at a boba shop. In a particular instance, I served an entire extended family, all of whom were deaf. Wrestling with the challenges of taking their orders, I initiated an efficient, yet last-minute system. While I was in charge of taking the orders, I asked one of my coworkers to go to the opposite side of the register and help the family choose what they wanted. On my side, I asked my other coworker to hear me repeat the orders aloud so that he could make the drinks in a fast manner. After being able to take their orders, their faces lit up, and they signed “thank you” to us. Given our limited menu scale, it took a lot of effort for these customers to convey their preferences effectively. I hoped that our store would implement more tools and accommodations for individuals with disabilities to ensure their shopping experiences were more seamless. Though I ultimately managed to assist them, I felt a mixture of satisfaction and inadequacy, recognizing that numerous businesses struggle to cater to people's unique needs. This specific encounter has changed my perspective on leading others. Working in such a diverse setting has deeply rooted within me a profound sense of empathy, reinforcing the importance of respecting unique perspectives, for it’s through these differences we can foster personal growth.

","I want to join Berkeley ABA because I’ve always been passionate about helping businesses grow and make smarter decisions. Running my own nail business in Berkeley taught me a lot about branding, operations, and financial management, but I realized that there’s so much more to business strategy than just intuition and hard work. I want to learn how to analyze real business challenges, make data-driven decisions, and develop strategies that create lasting impact.

I love problem-solving, brainstorming ideas, and figuring out how to turn challenges into opportunities. That’s why I’m excited about the hands-on experience ABA provides—working with real companies, breaking down complex problems, and learning from people who have been where I want to go. The skills I gain here won’t just be useful for a job; they’ll help me think differently, lead effectively, and build something bigger than myself.

Beyond the technical skills, I want to be part of a team of ambitious, like-minded individuals who push each other to grow. I thrive in collaborative environments where people challenge and support one another, and I know ABA is the perfect place for that.

At the end of the day, I’m not just looking for another club—I’m looking for an experience that will shape how I approach business, leadership, and problem-solving for years to come. I’m ready to learn, contribute, and grow with ABA.
","The ABA core value that best describes me is “Relentless Work Ethic.” Growing up in Nigeria, I learned perseverance early on. I understood that success isn’t given—it’s earned. My background shaped my mindset, teaching me to push past limitations, adapt quickly, and find solutions.

When I moved to the U.S. as part of a low-income household, I faced challenges adjusting to both financial burdens and the academic system. Instead of letting these obstacles hold me back, I took action. During high school, I started multiple businesses to support myself, and recently, I launched my own nail business in Berkeley, handling branding, operations, and financial management independently. Running a business while balancing school and other commitments was tough, but it strengthened my problem-solving, time management, and strategic thinking skills.

Beyond my entrepreneurial journey, my experience in consulting at Hubba exposed me to real-world business cases and strategic problem-solving. I worked on analyzing companies, developing growth strategies, and presenting solutions—an experience that deepened my interest in business strategy, consulting frameworks, and scaling businesses.

Additionally, as a Resident Assistant (RA), I’ve developed leadership in a different capacity—guiding students, fostering community, and handling conflicts. This role has enhanced my communication, decision-making, and team management skills—critical for business success.

I am eager to bring my resilience, leadership, and entrepreneurial experience to ABA while learning from peers and mentors.

I’ve always believed that hard work doesn’t have to come at the expense of enjoying the process, which is why ABA’s “work hard, play hard” energy really appeals to me.

I’ve heard a lot about ABA’s fast-paced, driven environment, and that’s exactly the kind of space I thrive in. Whether it’s collaborating on a business case, bouncing ideas off teammates, or celebrating wins together, I bring an easygoing, high-energy presence that makes working on challenging projects exciting.

I’m also a very visual and hands-on learner, so I enjoy tackling problems in a creative and strategic way. Whether in business, consulting, or leadership roles, I approach challenges with curiosity and adaptability.

Most importantly, I’m excited to learn from and contribute to a team of like-minded, driven individuals. I know ABA will push me to think sharper, work smarter, and grow alongside people who are just as passionate about business as I am.

Whether through school clubs that advocated for female reproductive rights to being the Outreach Director for a youth run mental health non-profit that focused on mental health advocacy, I’ve always wanted to leave an impact on the community that has given so much to me. Coming to college, I always knew that I wanted to go into business but not what in it exactly. When tabling at ABA, I was immediately drawn in by the uniqueness of the 5 different committees that all take on different projects within the realm of consulting. Non-profit work has always meant so much to me and I was so drawn in when learning about the past projects that ABA has done and the impact that they have had on organizations that change the lives of so many people. The best part to me however, was the ability to explore teams and try new things and projects amongst such an uplifting and supportive community that is so welcoming and helpful. Through ABA, I not only hope to gain professional experience, but I also hope to gain a newfound passion for a realm of business that I’ve never explored amongst a team of hardworking individuals that work together to make a truly great end result. I hope to expand my communication and collaboration skills, but most importantly create impactful and important relationships with my team and ABA as a whole. ","Throughout high school, I always had a passion for politics, specifically female reproductive rights, something that my parents always supported and encouraged me to pursue. However, growing up in a more conservative community, I realized that the ability that I had to learn about these things was not as accessible to many members of my community. What was the point of such important knowledge if I couldn’t share it with someone who could truly be impacted by it? This led me to my passion project in high school, starting a club called Women's Wellness (WW). Through WW I created an environment in which students, especially women, felt safe to learn about reproductive autonomy, especially with the current state of female bodily autonomy in the US and the overturning of Roe v. Wade. At WW, we advocate and educate students about female reproductive rights, and tools such as contraceptives through guest speakers from places like our local Planned Parenthood along with school-wide period product drives. We’ve created a space where students are encouraged to engage in discussions and learn information on reproductive legislation throughout the U.S. and even share their personal stories.

After attending info sessions, social mixers, and coffee chats over the past two semesters, I can confidently say that ABA is the kind of community I’ve been hoping to be a part of while coming to college.

Professionally, I hope that I can work with many other proactive individuals in ABA who have the ambition to not only focus on their own growth but uplift and push each other around them to achieve success together. I hope that if I were to join ABA, after gaining mentorship and gaining experience spending hours working on those rigorous but rewarding projects, I can be someone other newly joined members can turn to for guidance, just as I will have received when I first joined. Because college life is a constant cycle full of rejection, whether it's from internships, job interviews or even just having those bad days feeling sick or overwhelmed, I want to be part of a community where I can lean on others and be someone they can rely on too. At the end of the day, I want to find a community that feels like lifelong friends and family, and I see that in ABA.","Of ABA's five core values, I believe I best resonate #InIt2gether. Whether it was during high school or outside of the classroom, collaboration and teamwork has always been something pretty prevalent. As an executive of my high school’s Asian Cultures Association, we were inspired by New York public schools recognizing Lunar New Year and Diwali as academic holidays. In our predominantly white a small town in Pennsylvania where these holidays were often overlooked, we took initiative to push for a similar impact in our community. Despite our school board initially refusing to even consider our proposal, we ultimately succeeded by bringing together our district’s voices through flyers and spreading the word to implement a change that ultimately included all members of our community. What started as a group of club executives working toward a common goal grew into a very tight, strong bond that we continue to uphold to this day despite being across the country. With the success of adding Lunar New Year to my high school calendar, I hope I can continue to impact many other lives beyond my local community while working as a team and also find that close bond within ABA.

My career goal is to break into the tech + business sector and gain experience either through high growth startups or established corporations. Afterwards, I’m bringing the skills learnt back to my home country, Indonesia, to create a Software/EdTech startup where the gaps exist. As a side venture, I plan to build accessible schools throughout Indonesia to increase our literacy rate and place us on the map. As the 4th most populated country, barely anyone knows Indonesia.

ABA is unique because of its long standing history, consisting of an extensive alumni network and socially conscious individuals that further strive to make an impact. After talking to ABA's members, I realize that ABA will not only allow me to strive towards my career goals, but more importantly be a part of an extensive but amiable community that strives to improve each other professionally and mentally.","All of it resonates with me but I think Gain and Give best describes me!

Previously, I led a team of mentors to initiate a program at YPAC wherein we taught coding to disabled students. Initially, I assumed our challenge would be to effectively deliver scratch programming and web-design lessons. But upon arriving, I was shocked to find out that most of them were just starting to learn typing.

We completely adapted our approach to incorporate basic digital skills. Our planned 4-week curriculum turned to a 15-week journey, driven by the commitment to make an impact in their lives. In Alif, who faced not only stunted growth but also discrimination, I saw myself. As our sessions progressed, his resilience and inquisitiveness made him the quickest learner, and, gradually, his peers stopped teasing him and even began asking him for help. Today, he actively participates in web-design competitions and leads the computer club at YPAC.

These meaningful projects allow me to give back to the community, where efforts can tangibly impact lives. But it also allows me to gain knowledge and fulfillment. Consulting with real life companies will allow me to broaden my impact and not only positively impact the lives of thousands more, but also allow me to engender a journey of passion, friendship, and fulfillment.",NPO,Strategy,Business Development,https://drive.google.com/open?id=1LdTdHGbfUUPLEiYVpu31NF5M0iuWkNbg,"Instagram, Handbill/Flyer, Friend",Asian (including Indian subcontinent and Philippines origin),,28.0,28.0

As someone with a background in life sciences, research, and leadership roles, I am eager to bridge my technical expertise with business skills through ABA’s workshops, case competitions, and hands-on experiences. The opportunity to learn about strategic problem-solving and industry trends while collaborating with talented peers excites me, as I seek to gain exposure to fields like consulting, finance, and marketing.  

Through a team experience in ABA, I aim to refine key skills such as teamwork, leadership, and effective communication. In my past roles, including as a uLab mentor and NIH trainee, I have learned the importance of breaking down complex challenges, facilitating collaboration, and ensuring each team member feels empowered to contribute. I hope to bring this mindset to ABA by supporting team initiatives, brainstorming solutions, and contributing meaningfully to project goals.  

In return, I am eager to grow by learning from the experiences of others and receiving feedback on areas such as business strategy, data analysis, and client-facing presentations. ABA offers an environment where I can both give back and learn, and I am excited to embrace that dual role as a team player and driven learner. Through this experience, I hope to gain a strong foundation in business principles that will help me in future entrepreneurial or consulting endeavors.","Among ABA’s five core values, #BE – Be Humble, Be Ambitious, Be Tenacious best describes me because I balance ambition and persistence with the humility to learn from others and seek collective success. Throughout my academic and leadership experiences, I’ve seen firsthand how this mindset drives meaningful outcomes.

During my role as a uLab mentor, I guided a team of undergraduates in developing an epidemiology research paper. Leading the project required setting ambitious goals—ensuring the paper met publication standards while mentoring students who were new to research. I encouraged my team to aim high while remaining adaptable when challenges arose, such as delays in data analysis. When faced with obstacles, I demonstrated tenacity by working alongside the students, troubleshooting issues, and finding alternative solutions to keep the project on track.  

Humility played a key role, as I regularly sought input from my faculty mentors and encouraged open discussions within the team. By fostering a supportive environment, I ensured that success was shared, not individual. The project’s progress wasn’t defined by my leadership but by the growth of each team member, which ultimately led to a well-developed paper.

This value resonates with me because I believe in striving for excellence while recognizing that learning and collaboration are essential to achieving ambitious goals. In ABA, I would embody this value by contributing to team efforts, pursuing challenging projects, and helping others succeed along the way. Together, we can achieve results that reflect the power of collective ambition and resilience.",Marketing,Finance,Strategy,https://drive.google.com/open?id=1HGHEF1kGxEtjJcP0o3_2t9adUKmuhCW8,Friend,"Asian (including Indian subcontinent and Philippines origin), Native American or Other Pacific Islander",,29.0,29.0

Throughout the interview process everyone was very patient and understanding, making me want to be a part of the community. 
I hope to gain more professional development and business focused experience but also gain a community of people with similar like and professional goals. I love how ABA separates the projects into teams where you can focus more on one sector, which appeals to me because I want to go into either business development or NPO consulting. I have learned a lot since last semester, making me more confident I am a good fit for this organization and consulting in general. ","Take care of each other. The way I connect with people is by oversharing. Within the first ten seconds of talking to me, I’m already saying, “this is TMI, but whatever.” I’ve found that it sets the tone—everything’s fair game to talk about. I always aim to create a space that’s open, supportive, and full of humor, so people feel like they can be themselves and come to me for anything—whether it’s advice or just a hug. Being able to talk about anything and everything without judgment is how my loved ones and I take care of each other. It reminds us that we have a safe, supportive space.

Leading strategy for our startup, Sensit, I worked on improving engagement times and scaling our impact, which ultimately helped us win the national competition. On the finance side, my experience as Co-Founder of Earthfirst, a nonprofit that empowers visually impaired artisans, has taught me a lot about managing revenue streams and building a sustainable business model. Through this initiative, we generated S$15,000 in our first year, reinforcing my interest in financial strategy and operations.

Beyond entrepreneurship, I’ve worked in data analytics and software development, including a remote research internship at the University of South Florida, where I built a data pipeline to analyze molecular mechanics trends. I also developed a Cricket Shot Optimization Software, creating an algorithm to model air resistance on projectile motion. These experiences have helped me approach business challenges with a structured, analytical mindset—something I’d love to bring to ABA’s projects.

Ultimately, what draws me to ABA is the chance to work with a team that’s just as ambitious and curious as I am. I’m eager to contribute my skills in business strategy, financial analysis, and technology to real-world consulting projects while learning from the incredible community at ABA. ","Success Through Collaboration:
I was elected Deputy CEO of our 15-member team to represent our school in the Company of the Year Competition. The hardest part of any startup is finding that initial idea, and having a team with diverse perspectives helped us evaluate concepts effectively. After two weeks of endless discussions and discarded ideas, one teammate mentioned that her brother had ASD (autism), sparking our interest.
During a visit to a special needs school to explore this idea further, we recognized the lack of resources for ASD and ADHD communities. This led to the development of the Qube, a sensory-based learning aid. I balanced perspectives and mediated conflicts within the team, and personally drafted all three financial statements. We employed effective strategies, such as outsourcing production to reduce costs and leveraging seasonal promotions, including Christmas discounts—leading to a complete sellout within a month and generating $2,500 in revenue.
Committed to sustainability, we used organic cotton, linen, and recycled materials. I also applied electrical engineering principles, integrating sensors that enhanced the Qube’s learning capabilities. Our startup won the National Company of the Year Competition, but our greatest achievement was bringing the Qube back to the school and witnessing the children engage with it for 2–3 minutes—far surpassing the typical 5–10 seconds, and is the only learning aid to ever do so.

Everyone I met has been really approachable which helped create an inspiring environment that I would want to be a part of.

Moreover, the opportunities ABA offers with their consulting projects and engaging with industry professionals, aligns with my desire to gain experience in a collaborative setting. I’m really drawn to the idea of developing my skills in leadership, teamwork, and strategy while learning from upperclassmen who have gone through the process. These experiences would not only help me grow but also allow me to contribute meaningfully to my chosen team.

The idea of being just serious enough is one I try to embody through every aspect of life, whether it be work, social life, or simply enjoying the process. While I always aim to be competent in every thing I strive for, sometime just being chilled out makes all the difference, espcially when it comes to having better results and attitudes about life, friends, school or even family.

An example of this is during a project I did for my club ,Product Space, where I was responsible for working on decking for a deliverable for out client. While I ensured that I stayed on track and met deadlines, I made a conscious effort to try to keep a lighthearted  environment when we I was working with out team as it always made the work feel more like play. I believe this contributed in making the team bond more and in the end, our project was praised not only for its quality but also for our evident collabration and positive energy.

Whether it’s through incorporating humor in everything I do or taking breaks to recharge and reconnect with my friends and peers, I believe that creating an enjoyable environment fuels creativity, productivity, and better vibes.

The opportunity to work alongside like-minded peers and learn directly from experienced mentors will help me grow both technically and professional. Additionally, ABA’s emphasis on giving back—whether through mentorship or supporting NPOs—is something I strongly align with.

However, I am still figuring out which realm of the industry to participate in: there’s the research aspect, sales and acquisitions, and consulting. The intersection of healthcare and business interests me because I believe that the advancements we see in healthcare today would not be possible without the critical role that business plays. This collaboration is especially relevant to my passion for pharmaceuticals, where business brings groundbreaking discoveries from research to patients. I hope to gain more communication and analytic skills, and aim to become a more professional and confident speaker through casework, deliverables, and presentations. I believe that personable skills are necessary for success and growth in any career and research, and with ABA’s mentorship and support, I can readily apply these skills to my potential career. 

ABA caught my interest due to its emphasis on community and core values. Other consulting clubs focus heavily on technicalities and competition, and while ABA values casework, it doesn’t detract from its strong community. I particularly liked the values of Just Serious Enough and ABA Love, as I seek a community that is professionally driven but also genuinely cares about one another. ABA also has an established alumni and mentor network and a large client base I’d love to contribute to. Based on the information sessions, I was greatly attracted to the loving community which stuck to one another while also developing professionally together.","Raised where education is highly valued, I never faced struggles in accessing it. I recognized my advantages and realized many students don’t have the same opportunities, despite their potential. I believe education should be equally accessible to all.

With this in mind, I co-founded Orange County Advanced STEM Tutoring, a nonprofit organization aimed at introducing elementary students to advanced topics not typically covered in schools. As a co-founder, I handled marketing, communications, and made creative decisions. I also taught Astronomy, a subject I’m passionate about, to provide access to a topic often overlooked in early education. Our organization ran for eight semesters, and I received the Gold PVSA three years in a row for my dedication.

I also coached a Science Olympiad team, mentoring students, organizing meetings, managing funds, and communicating with parents and teachers. Volunteering in children’s education has been incredibly fulfilling, especially seeing students grow and discover a love for science. I hope to continue working toward making education more accessible to students from all backgrounds.

I believe ABA’s core value of #Gain&Give is best exemplified by my experiences of receiving a strong education, and giving it back to young students who lacked access to personal enrichment. I wanted to develop the traits I gained in SciOly, such as humility and leadership, in the following generation.

ABA, in particular, offers a wide variety of project teams with opportunities to collaborate with different people while finding innovative ways to address the needs of various organizations.

Beyond honing my technical skills, I hope to improve my ability to communicate and collaborate with my peers. The dynamic nature of business projects requires effective teamwork and clear communication, both of which are essential skills I want to further develop.

","The core value of #INIT2GETHER, success through collaboration, best describes me, as I believe that working together is key to solving complex problems and achieving success. Throughout my experiences, I have consistently stepped up to collaborate with diverse teams, taking on leadership roles when necessary and always prioritizing the collective success of the group.

One example of this is my Eagle Scout project, where I led a team to restore a community garden at a local park. The project required collaboration with fellow Scouts, community members, and park officials. I took ownership of organizing the tasks, delegating responsibilities, and ensuring the group stayed motivated. Despite facing challenges such as limited resources and varying schedules, I fostered a sense of unity within the team, which ultimately led to the successful completion of the project. We worked together to achieve a common goal, and the result was a revitalized community space that benefited everyone.

Another example is my participation in group projects during my coursework, such as in CS61A and CS61B. These projects required collaboration with classmates from diverse backgrounds and skill sets. I found that stepping up to take initiative, whether it was organizing tasks, facilitating communication, or offering help, was crucial to our success. I learned that leadership doesn’t always mean being in charge but involves empowering the team to achieve their goals together.

I'm specifically interested in this hands-on model of training, and I'm excited about contributing and growing at ABA.","The most apt value for me is #GAIN&GIVE – Learn and Give Back.

I co-founded MLBA NextGen and coordinated efforts in service to underprivileged communities in the U.S., Mexico, Guatemala, and Panama.

I recall one such case in funding a $20K acting scholarship for a young girl, Jollie, with aspirations to become an actress. After a high-profile acting camp, she booked a role in a Disney television series—showing the impact of providing access to opportunity for people.

Apart from my service work, I have been actively engaged with TikTok Shop. I have leveraged the platform’s affiliation scheme for marketing goods, generating sales and enhancing small businesses' web presence. I developed my sales, marketing, and e-commerce expertise through such work, and I have shared these experiences with fellow entrepreneurs who seek to expand their respective companies. By training them in using TikTok for commercial purposes, I have empowered them with a tool for expansion.

Throughout my life, my parents consistently ingrained in me the importance of using my resources for good, as they pushed me to volunteer in underserved communities in India. Upon reaching high school, I carried this value with me, using my experience as a volleyball player and swimmer to coach special needs children in these sports. Through this experience, I learned more about leadership and empathy from these children than I could ever teach them. Moments with these children reinforced my belief that true growth happens when we use our skills to help others. Aside from coaching, I also participated in an internship where I used data analysis to predict wildfire growth in the year 2023. My work was used by NOAA to predict evacuation orders for fires in 2023, helping me give back to the community. As I left the company, I took the data analysis skills I learned and taught them to new interns, knowing the importance the project held, and the need to keep giving back in the future. While both these experiences were part of projects at a greater scale than just me, I have always believed it is my duty to teach others skills I have gained, so they can continue giving back, and eventually create a cycle. I hope that, if I get the opportunity to join ABA, I will be able to continue doing this and, one day, teach the new ABA family the skills I’ve gained.

By organizing educational workshops and creating animated videos to simplify economics concepts, I made learning feel accessible and engaging. Seeing their renewed motivation and confidence was a defining moment for me—I realized that inspiring just one student could create a ripple effect, encouraging them to pursue their ambitions and uplift others.This experience reflects the mentorship mindset that ABA embodies—learning valuable skills and then giving back. As an international student, I know the importance of community, mentorship, and lifting others up.

Everyone I’ve met is not only sharp and ambitious but also easygoing and supportive. That balance is rare, and it’s exactly what draws me to ABA.

I’ve always been fascinated by the intersection of consulting, business, and tech, and ABA seems like the perfect place to explore that. The fact that you’re working with clients like WHO, Microsoft, and Google next semester is honestly insane. The projects are real, impactful, and actually push people to grow, and I want to be part of that environment—where people aren’t just doing things for the resume but because they care.

But beyond the professional side, ABA feels like a family, and that’s what really matters to me. As an out-of-state and international student, I don’t have family nearby, so I know how important it is to have a group that supports each other. Everyone here seems to have each other’s backs, and that kind of energy is something I want to be around. To me, ABA isn’t just about career growth—it’s about finding a community that pushes each other to be better, while actually having fun along the way.","When I first arrived in the U.S., I felt like a small fish thrown into an ocean. As an international student from Taiwan and an out-of-state student from Minnesota, every transition felt like a new wave crashing over me—new systems, new cultures, and countless unknowns. Fortunately, at every stage, someone was there to help me. Whether it was a mentor guiding me through my first college applications or an upperclassman showing me where to find resources, I never had to navigate alone. Their support didn’t just help me survive—it taught me the power of #GAIN&GIVE.

That’s why, whenever I see international students struggling—hesitant to ask questions, unsure where to go, or simply afraid to speak up—I don’t hesitate to step in. I know what it’s like to feel lost in a foreign system, and I refuse to let others go through it alone. Whether it’s directing them to career resources, helping them understand financial aid, or just encouraging them to take that first step, I make sure they know they’re not alone.

This commitment to helping others didn’t stop there. When I transferred to community college, I noticed the same struggles among first-year students—many felt lost, just as I once had. As a second-year student, I made it my goal to help—connecting them with career paths, recommending clubs that matched their personalities, and offering the guidance I once wished for. 

I remind myself that I was once in their position. Now that I have the ability to make a difference, I see it as my responsibility to do so—just as others once did for me.",NPO,Marketing,Strategy,https://drive.google.com/open?id=18nrFw3MAhbZudnx_mIymsOk0AB_jnkq6,"Friend, Coffee Chat",Asian (including Indian subcontinent and Philippines origin),"I was born in Orange County but spent most of my childhood in Taiwan. My education has been anything but conventional—I was homeschooled through middle school, then moved to Zhongli, Taiwan for my freshman year of high school. Sophomore year took me to Baltimore, Maryland, but before I could settle in, COVID hit, and I found myself relocating once again—this time to Minneapolis, Minnesota. After high school, I decided I couldn’t handle the freezing winters, so I packed up and moved to Cupertino, California for community college before finally transferring to Berkeley.

Constantly moving shaped me into someone who is incredibly adaptable, inclusive, and easygoing. When you’re always the “new kid,” you learn to connect with people from all walks of life—whether they’re from across the country or halfway around the world. At this point, if you told me you were from North Korea, I might actually believe you.
These experiences have given me a unique perspective on community and belonging. I don’t take friendships for granted, and I’ve learned to embrace change rather than fear it. No matter where I go, I find ways to build connections, stay open-minded, and appreciate different cultures and viewpoints.

And that’s a little bit about me—someone who’s lived in too many places to count, but sees the world as one big, interconnected community.",28.0,28.0

These qualities not only resonate with my own values but also highlight an environment where I could thrive and contribute meaningfully. More specifically, I believe ABA will not only give me a unique opportunity to bridge my diverse academic interests with business, but also develop universal skills that will continue to benefit me in the real world. 
As a cognitive science major on the pre-med track, my path is somewhat unconventional compared to other pre-med students. This peculiar choice of cognitive science stems from my broad interests in almost all fields–including business. My interest in many different subjects is why I’m so eager to immerse myself in the consulting world through Berkeley ABA while also completing my predominantly STEM agenda. 
Moreover, I hope to gain several valuable skills. I want to learn research methods, analytical thinking, and strategic planning to translate my ideas into tangible results for real-world clients and businesses. With my team, I hope to take on a leadership role that challenges me to step out of my comfort zone and hopefully develop a more assertive and dynamic leadership style. 
In time, I hope to utilize my passion for business to develop my consulting skills, and contribute to impactful projects with my team. I look forward to gaining practical experience, fostering strong meaningful friendships, and exploring how cognitive science and my pre-med track can intersect with my interest in business challenges and solutions.","In my high school yearbook classroom, my primary goal was to create a healthy culture of trust and inclusivity so that constructive criticism and collaboration would develop our best ideas into a cohesive product. Because of this, I made sure to incorporate the entire yearbook staff into the ideation process, helping staff members and I acquire different skills and attentively exchange ideas. 
We strived to make our next spreads better than the one before and pushed each other past our limits to allow each person the freedom to succeed in their respective roles. As a result, I believe “#Be, Be Humble, Be Ambitious, Be Tenacious” is the ABA core value that best describes me.
My strong commitment to #Be is how my yearbook team began to notice the enhanced focus and excitement in our yearbook community. Since the strength of our team lied in its collective knowledge and the ability to learn from one another, #Be was a fundamental part in creating an exceptional final yearbook product. 
I embraced my position as a design editor and leader: my role was not to only teach and assign work to my staff, but also learn from their contributions and model engagement, trust, and respect, a habit I also want to carry into ABA. 
After all, my success was my team’s success, and, with ABA, I hope to continue my dedication to #Be and cultivate a similar environment where excellence is modeled through consistent acknowledgment of individual contributions and nurturing the talents of every member for the best result possible.",Marketing,NPO,Strategy,https://drive.google.com/open?id=14hKLLNi0DH5t8zVA40hcODpycx9Gkv-c,"Instagram, Friend",Asian (including Indian subcontinent and Philippines origin),,28.0,28.0

The club’s emphasis on offering fresh perspectives, unique ideas, and detailed user research creates an invaluable opportunity for hands-on experience while working alongside industry professionals. Its distinct environment allows me to sharpen my analytical skills and deepen my understanding of consulting. What attracts me the most is ABA’s mission to develop well-rounded business leaders, providing the perfect platform to put my skills into action and grow personally and professionally.  

Majoring in EECS, I'm already receiving a solid technical foundation through my coursework and involvement in the CalSol Solar Car team. However, I would love the opportunity to delve into the application side of the spectrum. Consulting excites me because it allows me to explore how today’s products are applied, strategized, and effectively brought to market. Knowing the technical side is only part of the equation—understanding the bigger picture through consulting is what truly rounds out the skill set I want to develop.

I'm excited to connect with peers who share similar interests and to explore how our diverse passions intersect, creating interdisciplinary opportunities. Whether through late-night project collaborations or social events, I look forward to building meaningful and lasting relationships with fellow members. ABA members' unique experiences and perspectives will allow me to grow personally and professionally.

At ABA, I can apply my knowledge to real-world scenarios, working on meaningful projects that create tangible impacts. I'm eager to join a community of driven, talented individuals who will challenge me to think differently and help shape my perspective as we tackle global challenges.","Learn and give back

Over seven years as captain, I developed technical skills in building and programming robots, leadership, collaboration, and empathy. I guided my team through highs and lows—ranking in the bottom 10% at Nationals after a robot’s accidental fall, only to win the World Championship the following year. Despite years of exhausting challenges, I initially felt ready to step back during my senior year. However, with my school launching a fully developed VEX-Robotics program for the first time, I realized it was my responsibility as President to give back. I wanted my peers to experience the excitement and growth of robotics without the mistakes and struggles I'd faced.  

I coordinated purchases, led robot-building sessions, and taught members the rules, parts, and fundamentals. Membership doubled, and I spent countless hours mentoring my peers, ensuring they felt supported and inspired. I helped them refine their designs, code, and advanced algorithms like PID. Watching them grow—from beginners to earning awards—was one of the most rewarding experiences.  

My peers stayed after school for hours, excitedly discussing the new game season and prototyping robots. “This is all because of you,” my coach said. In that moment, I realized my impact went beyond just building robots—I’d sparked a passion for STEM and innovation within my community.  

My robotics journey has never been solely about awards. It's been about inspiring others, fostering collaboration, and creating a culture of curiosity and creativity. By investing in my peers, I’ve built a legacy of exploration and growth that continues to thrive.",Strategy,Business Development,Finance,https://drive.google.com/open?id=1CuPFYH8E9uPHfvSjyzLYXOu-SQ66Sgeq,"Instagram, Website, Handbill/Flyer, Friend",Asian (including Indian subcontinent and Philippines origin),,29.0,29.0

Through coffee chats with Yumin, Kaika and Eric, conversations at info sessions and case workshops with Minju, Lia and Adil, I was reaffirmed that ABA is more than just a professional organization and instead a tight knit group of individuals who share similar passions and goals to me. 


Coming back this semester, I’m even more eager to contribute and grow within this environment. As someone still developing my technical skills in business, I really value being surrounded by people who push me to improve while still focusing on success through teamwork and taking care of one another. I truly believe that for me to reach my full potential I have to be surrounded by people who care about me just as much as I care about them. 


What continues to draw me to ABA isn’t just the professional skills I hope to gain, it’s the people. After completing my first semester of college, I’ve found that finding friends isn’t too difficult, but finding those who truly align with my interests and future goals is rare. However, from my very first info session, ABA felt like home, and I’m excited for the chance to grow with such an inspiring and supportive group of people.","I believe that the core value that describes me best is “Learn and Give Back.” While I don’t necessarily play as often as I used to, over the 10 years that I’ve been playing baseball, I've had the privilege of being mentored by San Francisco’s best coaches. Their mentorship not only refined my physical skills like my swing and arm strength but also instilled in me core values like discipline, determination and focus, which continue to shape who I am today. 


Recognizing the tremendous impact my coaches had on me, I’ve taken every opportunity to give back as soon as I could. Whether that be assistant coaching my rec league team in middle school, coaching my younger brother’s team, or mentoring underclassmen during my senior year of highschool, I was always excited to share the knowledge I gained. I dedicated countless hours taking younger players to the field on weekends, creating individualized training plans and preparing future captains to lead the program. 


Beyond baseball, I actively mentor my younger brother and his friends, giving them academic advice on what classes/teachers to take based on my own experience and send them internship opportunities that I think they might be interested in. Looking ahead I hope to keep giving back, not only in future semesters of ABA but also to teenagers back home who are looking for guidance and opportunities but don’t have access to them.

I am particularly interested in ABA because of its business development team that focuses on product development, which many other consulting/business clubs do not have. I’d like to explore product management because of its design elements and I am specifically intrigued by the chance to learn about 3D modeling. Additionally, I can expand upon my interests in business and jump into ABA’s other teams to have a more holistic business education and experience. Aside from product development, I can also see myself thriving in the marketing team as it caters to my desire to work more creatively and think from a consumer point of view. 

By working in an ABA team, I’d like to find friendship and community within my passions while still developing professionally. As a freshman, I am still looking to find my home within this university, and I hope to discover that with the help of ABA’s core values of #ABALOVE and #JSE. ","ABA's core value #GAIN&GIVE resonates with me because of my enjoyment in seeing myself grow and passing off that knowledge to others. In high school, I looked up to a variety of people who were in leadership positions, participated in school events, and served as a role model for others. For example, my cheerleading team had a big/little system that paired me, a freshman at the time, with a junior who was the current president of our school's Key Club. I was inspired by her leadership and watched her slowly become more involved at school as our cheer captain, student leadership secretary, and a student at her dream college. When it eventually became my turn, I followed in her footsteps and did the same, succeeding in my own way through leadership positions, internships, and organizations, while still reaching out to her with questions. While I found myself growing, I also found myself wanting to help others as well. Soon enough, I was paired with my own little and took her under my wing, offering to answer questions and give the best advice I could. 

I still keep in contact with both my big and little, as they have both shapened my life in profound ways. My participation within this cycle of gaining and giving has opened my eyes to the power of mentorship and friendship, and I hope to facilitate this cycle within ABA.

We lacked many business organizations that were common in other schools, like FBLA and DECA. Hence, I took it upon myself to create those opportunities for myself. As I was surrounded by the arts, a lot of my work ended up being on the creative side: social media marketing, advertising, copywriting, and event planning.

Now at Berkeley, I wish to build upon the skills I gained in high school and apply them to real, tangible work. Of the 60+ consulting clubs on campus, ABA is the best place for me to do this. From what I’ve seen, ABA is unique from other clubs on campus because of the passion and spirit that runs through it. During the recruitment process, I felt a true sense of connection with my coffee chatters and the people I talked to during info sessions. It’s rare to feel so passionate about a club/organization, and see that same energy being reciprocated. This semester, what I really hope to get out of ABA is a community. I hope, and I know that ABA is where I’ll find a group of diverse, open-minded, and creative thinkers. There is so much to learn from each other; not just in technical terms, but also different cultures, traditions, and habits. 

In ABA, I look forward to seeing what doors will be opened as I embark on my college journey. I also look forward to opening doors for fellow ABA members, supporting each other to be the best versions of ourselves. ","#BE. BE HUMBLE. BE AMBITIOUS. BE TENACIOUS. BE CREATIVE. BE UNIQUE.

ABA’s core value “#BE” resonates the strongest with me, as I am always eager to learn and experience new things. I enjoy putting myself in almost uncomfortable situations, as I believe they allow me to grow the most. Thus, you probably won’t be surprised to see me doing bizarre, out-of-the-box activities here and there. With interests in the arts, humanities, sciences, and social sciences, I bring a wide range of experiences to the table.

This is my story that I’m willing to share and teach to others: whether it be through intensive karaoke sessions or pizza-making workshops. #BEing in ABA entices me with the possibility of discovering an endless library of stories, ones brimming full with the emotions, traditions, and lessons of other ABA members.

At Berkeley, I want to find a community I can always rely on, and I see ABA making that happen. With my family so far away, loneliness is inevitable at times, but ABA’s warmth and tight-knit culture stood out to me. More than just the fun socials, I was drawn to the strong bonds I saw–whether it was through coffee chats, info sessions, or watching my close friends find their home in ABA and fall in love with Berkeley because of it. Seeing members support each other–through late-night study sessions, project collaborations, or simply being there for one another–I knew this was a community I wanted to be a part of.
Beyond the friendships, I admire ABA’s ability to foster both comfort and academic excellence. Working with renowned clients across industries, members gain exposure to different fields, making it easy to explore new interests. Growing up, I had a singular focus on becoming a doctor, but I’ve recently realized how much more is out there. I’m committed to keeping an open mind and discovering new strengths through the variety of projects ABA has to offer. I hope to gain not only industry knowledge but also a lifelong support system–a group of people with whom I can share my hobbies, lessons, projects, and my experience at Berkeley, making my time here truly meaningful. ","When I was diagnosed with a rare thyroid cancer in my teens, uncertainty and fear took over. Missing school and falling behind felt like the start of a downward spiral, but I never wanted to let cancer be the essence of my story. Instead of sulking, I wanted to turn this experience into a source of motivation.
Eager to find an alternative to the pain that patients, including myself, endured, I joined Professor Konofagou’s lab to pursue cancer research. Working alongside my team, I explored high-intensity focused ultrasound (FUS) as a noninvasive breast cancer treatment. We started with tests on chicken breast tissue, then advanced to mouse models, and eventually patient studies at Columbia University Irving Medical Center. Every day, we questioned results, refined methods, and strived for a greater impact. The rare moments we saw a tumor disappear reinforced why we kept going. It may have been a modest step in the broader fight against cancer, but it symbolized a significant stride for us–transforming a personal challenge into a purpose.
This experience shaped my mindset: never settle, always strive for more. I resonate deeply with ABA’s core values–humility in knowing there’s always more to learn, ambition in chasing the next breakthrough, and tenacity in never backing down from challenges.

Being ambitious drives me to set my future goals and keeps me pushing forward, constantly taking the next step forward.

The Puente Program is a UC sponsored college bridge program that provides students with academic and college application support.

I aspire to work on a team where I’m constantly challenged but also supported along the way; and given ABA’s emphasis on family and relationships, I’m assured that I will be welcomed in a community as such. 

I further seek opportunities that will situate me in dynamic, problem-solving environments, and I know that ABA’s real-world consulting projects with major companies like Chase and Google will challenge me to think critically, develop structured solutions, and communicate effectively in real, high-pressure scenarios. Beyond technical skills, I’m excited to develop my adaptability – that is, learning when and how to pivot, and just as importantly, approaching challenges from multiple angles.

As such, one example that comes to mind is the completion of my Eagle Scout project, where I led a team of friends in designing, constructing, and documenting the building of bookshelf benches for a third-grade class at a local Title I school. While the project required meticulous planning, coordination, and lots of effort, what truly made it so rewarding was the process – from the not-so-funny jokes and vibrant conversations to the mini Costco pizza breaks to the “Hey guys, I don’t think this is very sturdy” while wobbling on the benches. These moments, filled with such laughter and smiles, are the moments that I will continue to hold onto. 

In the end, we polished three (sturdy, I must add) bookshelf benches that I delivered to the classroom. And the following day, I had the privilege of witnessing my creation in action: the kids hastily springing up from their seats and excitedly stowing their textbooks into the shelves – a memory I'll never forget. Today, reflecting on this experience, I recognize that this meaningful project wasn’t just about what I accomplished, but the moments spent with my friends talking and laughing in the process. Because after all, smiles mean the most when they’re shared.

My experience as the assistant marketing director at Capistrano Senior Living showed me firsthand how branding, outreach, and storytelling can shape public perception and brand awareness. By leading a promotional photo series and creating a high school-styled “yearbook” for the senior residents, I saw how creative marketing plays a crucial role in the growth of an organization and the impact it can have on a community. My work with the retirement home ensured that its services and resources reached those who needed it the most—not only near the facility’s location but across several neighboring cities. Through ABA, I hope to refine my analysis of market trends, learn how to identify and design customer segmentations, and create compelling brand narratives. I want to explore specifically how companies not only attract customers but build long-term brand loyalty. Additionally, working in a team-driven environment will help me hone my skills in the collaboration and execution of plans in high-pressure situations. Since my intended major is based on the intersection of health and business, I would love to have the chance to work on companies and nonprofits shaping the field of biotech and healthcare today. As I have seen with the SF AIDS Foundation’s testimonial on ABA’s work, I believe joining ABA will allow me to contribute to meaningful projects that make a substantial impact.","Success Through Collaboration defines how I approach challenges—by working with others to create something greater than what any individual could achieve alone. As an intern for the city government of Irvine, I worked alongside students from across Orange and Los Angeles counties to develop strategies for improving civic engagement with first responders. Collaborating with peers from all backgrounds, I helped collect public opinion data through online polls sent electronically to local residents and representatives. One of my key responsibilities was engaging directly with city leadership, including the mayor and council. Therefore, I was able to serve as a link between the discussions I had with fellow interns and the tangible leadership of Irvine. We presented insights on how favorable the community’s views toward the police are, how quickly first responders would generally arrive at scenes, and possible outreach initiatives to bring the community and first responders closer together. With my skills in graphic design, I also had the unique opportunity to design signs with another intern experienced in typography for the National Night Out—an event aimed at building healthier relationships between residents and first responders. Additionally, I helped catalog the city’s corporate partnerships and local companies’ contributions to the people of Irvine, as many major companies from Taco Bell to Mazda are headquartered in the city. By coordinating with other interns, engaging with government officials, and liaising with business leaders, I contributed to a multifaceted approach to civic engagement, ensuring that our strategies were community-focused.",Strategy,Marketing,NPO,https://drive.google.com/open?id=1DxMfkGDAnGxWWI536yeDBkMWWMxtPpe8,"Instagram, Website, Handbill/Flyer, Friend",Asian (including Indian subcontinent and Philippines origin),,30.0,28.0

One of the primary things I hope to gain from ABA is a vibrant community of like-minded, ambitious, and driven peers who share my passion for finance and business. I’m eager to tap into the invaluable mentorship and extensive educational curriculum of technical knowledge and professional development offered by ABA to its members to prepare myself for a future career in finance and business. I also look forward to having access to ABA’s vast network of accomplished alumni as an vital resource I'm keen to leverage in my professional growth and development. 

Additionally, I see ABA not only as an opportunity to develop professionally and build professional relationships but also join a close-knit group of friends who support each other and have fun, creating lasting memories together. I also appreciate how ABA gives members the opportunity to gain real world experience by consulting and working with household name brands, with its extensive network of clients and corporate partners. I believe ABA would be a great fit for me as I think it is a perfect blend of both professional and fun atmospheres where goals are accomplished but members are still part of a tight knit community where fun happens and memories are made, which exactly matches what I am seeking.","I believe ABA's core value of learning and giving back to others is the one that best describes and aligns with my character. I think that it is extremely important to remain grateful for the opportunities and support that allowed you rise to the heights where you are today and honor that by giving back your time and expertise to the next generation, whose shoes you were once in. I feel that my past experiences in creative writing best exemplify this core value, which has alway been an hobby of mine as I am passionate about creating and exploring new worlds through fiction. 

One of the past experiences that best reflect this value was my position as Editor-in-Chief of my high school's writing club, where I was able to mentor younger members on their writing by helping edit their pieces and providing developmental feedback as well as teaching both the fundamentals as well as more complex writing techniques. By workshopping each club member's pieces one-on-one and helping them understand the writing process from beginning to end, they were able to developing their confidence as they found their unique writing styles and niches. Throughout the years, I have developed my own skills through individual practice and research and learning from the works of renowned authors, resulting in the publication of my own works and multiple wins in national writing contests, including a National Gold Medal in the Scholastic Art & Writing Awards. 

Outside of just the members of my high school’s writing club, I have also mentored students from local middle schools.

The way ABA members engage with both enthusiasm and professionalism makes me excited about the possibility of growing alongside such a team.

I am particularly drawn to the Finance Team because of my strong interest in both economics and biology. My passion lies at the intersection of macroeconomics, finance, and policy, as well as the biotech industry, and I hope to explore how these fields connect. When I learned that Roche was a client, I was especially excited about the opportunity to work on projects that align with my interests. Through ABA, I aim to apply my knowledge to real-world cases and develop strong presentation skills by creating visually compelling deliverables.

Beyond the Finance Team, I have also had the opportunity to speak with members of the Strategy Team and was struck by how approachable and supportive everyone was. Conversations with Nia and Landon felt natural and pressure-free, reinforcing my excitement to collaborate in a team setting.

Before discovering ABA, I spent most of my college experience in the Taiwanese Student Association (TSA), where humility and collaboration were deeply valued. We supported each other by sharing our strengths and learning from one another. However, while TSA fostered a strong sense of community, it lacked the level of ambition needed to push us toward our personal and professional aspirations.

ABA’s #BE value deeply resonates with me because it reflects the balance of humility, ambition, and tenacity I strive for.

Clubs: applying to the Debate Society of Berkeley","I am drawn to ABA not only because of its reputation as a renowned consulting club but also because of the rich history ABA possesses. ABA’s legacy, built over 50 years of dedication, offers an incomparable foundation of knowledge and experience. The vast alumni network further amplifies this legacy, showing the transformative impact of being a part of ABA. This connection to a larger community is unparalleled and makes the club stand out from other clubs.

Two of my close friends Srivishal Sudharsan and Willis Yang are ABA members, and I really get along with their vibe, serving as a miniature of ABA’s culture. Through them, I’ve glimpsed the “work hard, play hard” culture that I deeply resonate with. I can already envision myself bonding with other club members, going on retreats and trips together, and building relationships that extend far beyond our time in college.

Through ABA, I hope to gain more than just consulting skills. I hope to broaden my understanding of problem-solving, strategy, and teamwork in ways that challenge and motivate me. As a future entrepreneur, I also wish to learn more about each industry and the business mindset. Joining one of the five unique teams and working with both large and small clients in ABA allows me to gain deep insights into the criteria and the ability to solve all kinds of problems. Ultimately, I see ABA as more than a club—it’s a community where I can grow, be inspired, and inspire others in return.
","The words ""gain and give value"" best describe me. In high school, my peers shared an interest in biology, but many complained about their lack of laboratory experience due to limited recourses. To resolve this problem, I aimed to lead a research project and unlock an unused laboratory I discovered in the corner of the school.
To take action, I crafted a group research project to help peers who needed research experience. Since we were amid the pandemic, I knew everyone's concern was about microbial infections and environmental cleanliness. Hence, I designed a project by inspecting the distribution of microbials within our school, which is suitable for both executions using the lab's existing instruments and feasible for garnering the participation of students new to such research. 

Voted as the president of my school's Biomedical Club allowed me to negotiate with the school to bring the laboratory to life and move forward with the work we hoped to complete. Providing credibility with my 4-year research at Peking University and detailed project plans, I was finally granted permission to use the lab to conduct the research.
Thanks to our unwavering cooperation, we constructed a computer model simulating the opening of windows for air ventilation. After presenting the findings to the school principal and administration, we implemented the air sanitation plan in over 150 classrooms, producing a real change in the air quality in our classrooms.

I’ve learned how to break down complex problems, apply theoretical knowledge, and find solutions, but I also recognize that nothing exists in a bubble. To truly grow, I need to improve my ability to communicate these ideas clearly and effectively. I believe that while critical thinking is essential, the ability to explain these complex concepts is arguably even more valuable. ABA offers the perfect environment for me to not only think critically but also translate those ideas into clear, actionable solutions.

Consulting is an exciting opportunity to bridge the worlds of technical analysis and communication. I want to refine my ability to work through cases, develop strategies, and collaborate with a team. ABA’s focus on consulting and business strategy is a natural fit for my interests, as it allows me to apply my skills while expanding into new areas.

Rock climbing has been a defining part of my life for over 13 years. Starting at a summer camp at age five and later competing at an international level, climbing has taught me problem-solving, adaptability, and perseverance. Each route presents a puzzle, and the process of analyzing, failing, and trying again has shaped my approach to tackling obstacles in all areas of life.

What draws me most to the sport, however, is the strong sense of community it fosters. As I grew more experienced, I sought ways to give back to the community that shaped me. I began coaching the same youth climbing team I once was a part of, helping young athletes build confidence and hone their skills. It’s been incredibly rewarding to mentor the next generation.

I also recognized that climbing can be an expensive sport, and financial barriers prevent many from participating. At my Title 1 high school, where over 40% of students came from low-income backgrounds, many of my friends wanted to climb but couldn’t afford memberships or gear. Determined to make climbing more accessible, I founded the Climb Together Initiative. By partnering with local gyms, I negotiated discounted rates, saving over $15,000 for students. 

Climbing has given me so much, and I’m grateful for the opportunity to pay it forward.

Furthermore, as someone who wants a career in business but is unsure as to which field I want to pursue, the unique opportunity to work hands-on in these different fields would be extremely beneficial. I would also learn so much from the opportunity to take part in real world projects, and gaining this experience would better prepare me for my career. My personal values also closely align with ABA’s values, especially ABA love. I want to be surrounded by people who share these same values and that is why I can see myself thriving at ABA.

","Give and Gain
One hundred and twenty-six: the number of kicks, forms, and sparring requirements I’ve mastered on my journey to a second degree black belt in taekwondo. In 2021, the studio owner noticed my skill and consistent training, and invited me to join his instructor team. I teach 4-5 classes a week, planning content specifically for each belt level–a front kick in lower levels, a 360-degree roundhouse tornado kick in higher levels. As students work on perfecting these new skills, I walk around, giving constructive feedback and encouragement: “Your side kicks are so high Connor!” “Keep your toes curled.” 
I remember my experiences when I first started taekwondo, how clueless and unsure of myself I was–how intimidating everyone else seemed. But most of all, I remember my instructors who encouraged me, highlighting my improvements, pushing me to practice at home, and reminding me they believed in me. In my leadership role at the studio, I work hard to inspire this same passion, as I balance making classes fun while still pushing toward improvement. 
When my students tell me they practiced their poomsae at home, or I see them show up five times a week to class instead of the regular two, or they want to show me how much stronger or higher they can kick, or they encourage or give helpful feedback to their peers–I know I have succeeded.

In fact, he’s passed down that love to me. The hiking trails at Skyline Gate, the gondolas at the Oakland Zoo, and the farmers markets every Sunday, are some of the things I love most about Oakland. However, the widespread homelessness here, and more broadly, in California, overshadows these beauties. Growing up and living in Oakland, I see homelessness everyday, and I’ve seen it my whole life. California has the largest homeless population in the country and they deserve better. I started researching to see what was being done to help this crisis and discovered state legislation that was being introduced to help. I started promoting bills for affordable housing like SB 423 (housing approval) which forces local governments to streamline projects if the city has not met its state-mandated housing targets. 

I also advocated for more funding for mental health resources for the homeless. I researched upcoming bills related to homelessness such as AB 531 (mental health bond) and SB 326 (mental health spending) which will be placed on the 2025 ballot for California voters to decide if they want to fund housing for mentally ill Californians who need residential treatment, and to change the way the state spends tax revenue for mental health services. I promoted these bills to friends, family, and peers, as well as on social media, educating and encouraging people to spread the word. I believe it is so important for Californians to vote on these issues because these state bills have such a large impact on local communities. Real progress can be made through the passing of this legislation, and together, we can make a huge impact on tackling homelessness.

As a public health and business major, I am eager to apply strategy to create meaningful change in real-world projects. During my interactions with ABA members, I felt welcomed and supported. Hilary’s president speech about the importance of taking time to discover your path, even in an environment like Berkeley, resonated deeply with me. I remember my conversations with Erin and Elaina in particular as we talked about being public health majors and I felt grateful for their willingness to greet me as a friend and offer advice. 

Along with that, the case workshop, led by Ellie, was such a great learning experience. In just an hour, her constructive feedback helped me grow and boost my confidence.

I appreciate ABA’s culture of giving back and helping each other grow through mentorship. I’m excited to refine my consulting skills while making a tangible difference for clients.

I am confident that joining Berkeley ABA will allow me to enhance my problem-solving abilities, learn from diverse perspectives, and be part of a team that strives for excellence. I look forward to contributing my insights while growing both personally and professionally in such a dynamic and inspiring environment.","ABA’s core value of ""Just Serious Enough"" best describes me. As Hilary shared how being an older sister shaped her character, I reflected on my own perspective as a younger sister. Growing up, I’ve always tried to find joy in the little things. For instance, when tensions rise between my older sister and dad, I often step in to mediate and lighten the mood. Now, as a student at Berkeley, a reality that was once beyond my wildest dreams, I continue to embrace this joyful approach even when things get hard.

Being a Pisces also plays a role in how I approach life—I tend to think creatively and thrive on spontaneity. But when it’s time to work, I balance that creativity with a strong work ethic, understanding that life doesn’t have to be so rigid.

This mindset has shaped my approach to academics and personal projects. As a student at Cal, I’m learning how to manage my time effectively—knowing when to enjoy cards with my floor and when to lock in. My passion for music and the arts requires discipline, but I also understand the importance of letting loose and enjoying the process with fellow dancers and musicians. I believe striking this balance makes the work more enjoyable and, ultimately, more productive.

As I was on my way to class one Monday morning, I was handed at least five papers telling me to join a club. One of these was from ABA Consulting, which prompted me to do a deep dive into the organization, as I was intrigued by its rich history at Berkeley and the longstanding client-based projects. I thereafter realized ABA’s distinctive nature from other consulting clubs; from its diverse community and representation, to their mission and being a business organization and consulting club in one really attracted me to it. ABA being home to the MX Business talent show serves to drive my interest in getting involved in a community that holds great merit in being a beaming network of Berkeley’s greatest innovators. Additionally, the team experience is something I look forward to, particularly because I will be able to truly enrich my business acumen by working closely with, and moving between the five project teams. From this I hope to gain a sense of community, enrich my analytical thinking skills, deepen my understanding of consulting methodologies, gain hands-on contact with non profits by providing consulting services, as well as gain exposure to the industry’s market challenges.

","Although I can confidently say that I abide by all of ABA’s core values, one in particular accurately characterizes myself. The value of “#BE”, that is to be humble, ambitious and tenacious is a key tenet of my own philosophy. Growing up in a Ukrainian/Russian household, I was brought up with a mentality that put hard work, deep motivation, and resilience at the forefront. Although I value personal ambition and independence, collaboration and expression with peers is a central idea that allows for being humble, ambitious and tenacious in all that I am. I have taken great inspiration from my parents who immigrated to the United States with nothing but a Russian college education that was not credible in their new country. They have had to navigate through language barriers, as well as the difficulty of creating a new life in the U.S. all by themselves. To me, they are the epitome of ambition and tenacity as the foundation of growth, and their success story has made me intrigued in wanting to meet people from around the world and walks of life to further build my business acumen. Today, I am always chasing a new opportunity to fulfill my desire of giving back to the communities that have fostered my growth, and I hope to join a team of bright, like-minded individuals who are passionate for business and consulting. I hope to be able to bring leadership as well as humility, tenacity, and ambition to the forefront of ABA.

Math 16A: Analytics Geometry and Calculus","     In an office above the world-renowned bustling food hall in downtown LA, I realized the importance of being passionate about what you do. In the summer of my freshman year, I had the opportunity to shadow a real estate developer in Los Angeles, which culminated in working in management for his crown asset, Grand Central Market in DTLA. Through creating marketing campaigns, remedying tenant relations on the day to day, and developing growth strategies for the market while maintaining its character and charm, I developed a passion for problem solving. From resolving issues of overstaffing and rent collections, I enjoyed engaging with people and seeing immediate results. However, my passion truly materialized when I helped incubate a concept called Market Bazar, a weekend flea market that hosted local vendors from the LA area, ultimately generating a 35% increase in visitation prior to its implementation. I hope to join ABA simply because I see  my Berkeley experience beyond attending classes. I wish to engage daily with work I would find in the real world, learn through challenging experiences, and grow my skill set.  ABA is well suited for my professional and personal goals, as it provides immediate hands-on experience in developing business strategy and market analysis. Specifically, I am drawn to ABA given the projects it attracts. ABA’s spring 2024 project, Trainline, is particularly attractive as it provided an interesting dimension to business problem solving and strategy as the European company sought advice on its introduction to the American market. In the case of Trainline, the process of advising a European company on introduction into an American market provides opportunities to learn concepts like Market Analysis through analyzing consumer behavior and competitor’s business strategies. such as analyzing that of supercell’s, which Yumin had mentioned, and Business strategy through providing actionable insights into entering an American Market.","    Microfinance. It sounds like miniature paper bills, but in reality, it empowers small business owners through small loans to provide for themselves and their families as they provide valuable goods, services, and jobs. By lending an ear and connecting with these business owners on the uncommonly considered obstacles that stand between them and success, I gained a new perspective on the effort that goes into starting up and later thriving. Founding the Microfinance Club at my school, I began a grassroots campaign not only to bring financial assistance to businesses in my community, but also to educate them on the resources at their disposal to help themselves. Attending the SAM Initiative Annual Conference, an organization devoted to providing grants for low-income individuals, my club conducted intense research to uncover the businesses most in need of support and played a crucial role in advocating for their awarding of a $100,000 grant. The fact that I was able to help get these funds into the hands of deserving individuals is one of the most gratifying achievements of my life. Through my work in microfinance, I believe I channeled the ABA value of “Learn and Give Back”, by practicing market analysis when analyzing firms most in need of assistance the most, and client communication while advocating for said firms in larger conferences. Seeing how my efforts have both positively impacted the lives of small business owners and fostered a spirit of inclusion within my community has only solidified my mission to use microfinance to help those in need.

During my first experience casing with ABA at the workshop, I saw how powerful collaboration can be. The workshop focused on a case for a fictional high-end children's apparel brand, Rainbow Apparel. I felt a sense of synergy, much like in a game when a team works seamlessly together. The environment was open and inclusive, where no idea was considered ""bad"", allowing everyone to share their thoughts freely.
As we worked through the case, I found myself in a supportive role, assessing the group dynamic and building on others suggestions. I enjoyed how naturally our plan of action fell into place, much like strategizing in a game where every player’s input is essential. This collaborative approach, where each member's ideas were valued, allowed us to form a comprehensive strategy for Rainbow Apparel. 
My experience in ABA’s casing workshop mirrored the dynamics of playing Support in games like League of Legends, where anticipating teammates’ needs and enhancing their strengths is crucial. I hope to bring this mindset to ABA, focusing on collaboration, adaptability, and creating an inclusive environment. By learning from my peers and contributing my unique perspective, I believe I can help the team achieve its goals, much like how a well-played support character enables a team to win.","Among ABA's core values, ""Learn and Give Back"" best represents me. This value resonates with my journey in dance, where learning from others and sharing my knowledge has been a central theme. Three years ago, when I first joined a dance studio, I struggled with stiffness, and my movements looked unnatural. With the consistent support and understanding of my instructors, I grew more confident in dance. Their dedication to my growth was so impactful that I was eventually offered a job at the studio.
Inspired by my instructors, I sought to give back by founding a dance club at my academically focused high school, targeting low-income, first-generation students. In club meetings, I taught dance to students who were learning for the first time, just as my instructors had done for me. This experience taught me the importance of mentorship, patience, and creating an inclusive environment where everyone feels supported.
I see a parallel between this experience and the business world. In both, growth comes from a continuous cycle of learning from those around you and giving back by uplifting others. Just as I helped new dancers find confidence, I hope to bring this value to ABA by learning from my peers, contributing my insights, and supporting the team in achieving collective success.",Marketing,Business Development,Strategy,https://drive.google.com/open?id=1smdRaEACr1R9-U1AEAKz07jHat2AQcR9,Handbill/Flyer,Asian (including Indian subcontinent and Philippines origin),,27.0,28.0

As someone eager to expand my knowledge in finance, joining the Finance Team presents an exciting opportunity to apply financial concepts in a real-world setting while being surrounded by like-minded individuals who are both ambitious and collaborative. Finance is a field that thrives on precision, strategy, and teamwork, and I want to immerse myself in an environment where I can strengthen my analytical skills while also learning from experienced peers.

Beyond technical knowledge, I hope to gain valuable experience in working within a team. Effective teamwork isn’t just about dividing tasks—it’s about learning to communicate ideas clearly, adapt to different working styles, and collaborate toward a shared goal. Being part of a finance team means making decisions that impact the broader organization, and I want to develop the ability to navigate challenges, balance responsibilities, and contribute meaningfully in high-stakes situations.

Additionally, ABA’s strong sense of community is something I want to be part of. The best learning happens in environments where people support each other, push one another to improve, and celebrate shared successes. I look forward to not only gaining technical finance experience but also forging meaningful connections with peers who are driven and passionate about their work. Through ABA, I hope to grow both professionally and personally, preparing myself for future leadership roles in finance while building lifelong relationships along the way.","The ABA Core Value that resonates with me the most is #INIT2GETHER. I believe real progress and innovation come from challenging established norms and pushing for change, even when it feels uncomfortable or risky. This mindset is crucial for fostering inclusivity, driving social change, and finding better solutions to complex problems. This principle resonates with me because I see it as a way to unlock potential—whether in organizations, systems, or society. It's not about breaking tradition for the sake of change, but about rethinking structures to create a more equitable and effective future. One experience that solidified this belief was at the California Boys and Girls State Program. I questioned why girls couldn't participate in the nationwide Boys Nation Program. The tradition of separate programs was deeply ingrained, and there was resistance from stakeholders who felt change would undermine the program’s history. I respected the tradition but advocated for inclusivity, collaborating with others to draft a bill addressing the disparity. Though we didn’t achieve immediate change, we started a much-needed conversation. This experience reinforced my commitment to challenging the status quo. It showed me that questioning systems is often the first step toward progress. I carry this mindset forward, knowing real leadership requires the courage to challenge norms for a better future.",Finance,NPO,Strategy,https://drive.google.com/open?id=11ZENiMwLCEUGCloZNVjn4c0Xd61EGQjn,Friend,Asian (including Indian subcontinent and Philippines origin),,28.0,28.0

","ABA is a creative incubator where I can turn the team's and clients' rich ideas into tangible solutions with the visionary and diverse team I’d be privileged to work with. Hearing Chloe Chon’s exertion of creativity to the World Wildlife Fund project bolstered my appreciation for ABA’s interdisciplinary, service-oriented nature. Under the same vision, I hope to apply my climate-oriented experience in non-profit mobilizing to projects across all teams concerning sustainable NPOs, climate health, green currency, market strategies, and more. Through my voice, language, and experiences, I’m eager to generate multi-perspective conversations among the ABA family and alumni that will inform the framework of current and future initiatives. In doing so, I’ll learn from and with the team, as we create a space in which we give as much as we gain while advancing the mission of the clients we serve. 

Moreover, making my mark on ABA is an asset to further my passion for the intersection between consulting, policy, and climate equity in a way no other campus opportunity can. Given ABA’s exceptional record, I’m confident I can gain the technical and soft skills needed to fulfill my pursuit through opportunities to represent ABA beyond campus. However, nothing screams my name more than #ABALOVE. I’m ecstatic at the prospect of collaborating, innovating, and celebrating with a second family, bound by retreats and socials, spontaneous study sessions, and, most importantly, ideating the next big thing. ABA's community will enable me to evolve as a student, citizen, and person guided by the group’s core values.
","ABA DNA REPORT - SUBJECT: VIVIAN DENG 

PRIMARY GENE: #JustSeriousEnough

	ORIGIN: Upon founding my international non-profit dedicated to bolstering Haitians in humanitarian distress, Green With Haiti (GWH), in 2022, I embarked on leading in hopes of steering GWH into success. However, working with an inaugural team of youth spanning multiple regions in GWH’s premature months, I was fixated on delivering impact on a fixed timeline. From the leadership standpoint, I succeeded in hosting weekly meetings and drafting elaborate agendas, but what about the team? I failed to offer a collaborative space to work on projects, identify group concerns, and promote a sense of camaraderie. Despite the nature of collaboration within a hybrid environment, complemented by a host of perspectives, I amalgamated and gauged each member’s feedback to change how I approach leadership. 

The once stoic leader was styled into an empathetic, unfettered one. By switching to bi-weekly meetings to accommodate schedules, cracking jokes with members while drafting emails, designating more opportunities for collective discussion, and planning hybrid socials, I forged a two-way rapport with the team, with which I became a friend, listener, and supporter. The synergistic dynamic of GWH defines its success rather than its professional projects. 

RESULT: I’m a comedy enthusiast! The merits of my work are attributed to an approach to compassionate and humorous ownership. At ABA, I aspire to catalyze communal laughs amid defeat and dejection, using it to diffuse tense relationships concerning everyone’s boundaries and perspectives. In short, I will spread ABALOVE through unsolicited wit and puns.

Currently, I work as a student researcher at the School of Information and the Goldman School of Public Policy. This role has a flexible commitment, with only one in-person meeting per week.

I am also involved in residential leadership as the Blackwell Hall Representative and a member of the Residential Hall Association Finance and Operations Committee (3-4 hours per week). However, I may transition out of this role depending on other opportunities in Spring 2025.","To call ABA my home away from home would be an honor. The fact that it is the oldest business organization at Berkeley speaks for itself. Running any club is difficult, but sustaining one for almost triple my age while staying relevant is an entirely different feat. ABA’s longevity proves its ability to cultivate lasting impact. I hope to contribute to this legacy. 

I am still exploring which business niche excites me most, so I deeply value flexibility and experimentation. Many business clubs at Berkeley focus on specific industries, but what excites me about ABA is the ability to gain exposure to multiple areas of business without being confined to a single path. With five project teams, I have the option to choose a different focus each semester, take on new challenges, and refine my strengths along the way. ABA offers the rare chance to learn and grow without the pressure of having everything figured out from the start.

While technical skills will come with time, what excites me most is learning from the people. Everyone brings unique perspectives and approaches problems differently, and I hope to add my own to that mix. After all, diverse ways of thinking drive the best ideas forward. ABA is a place where those ideas come together, and I hope to be part of a team that challenges my thinking and helps me see solutions I would not have considered alone.","Everyone has responsibilities. For me, that means being a student, co-worker, sister, and friend. However, a meaningful life is more than a never ending to-do list. Personally, #JSE means knowing when to push myself and when to step back, recharge, and enjoy the moment. 

At 15, I entered real estate and braved Manila traffic to tour clients. It was rewarding, but some days, I barely had time for myself. At first, I saw my job as a series of tasks, for instance, memorizing property details or answering phone calls. However, when I slowed down and truly engaged with clients, my tours became conversations I looked forward to. Clients would start by asking about square footage but end up reminiscing about childhood homes or sharing their dream vacations. That experience taught me that hard work is necessary, but perspective matters too. A simple mindset shift can turn the ordinary into something meaningful. 

I carry this approach into every new challenge. Responsibilities will always be there, but how I engage with them makes the difference. That is why I commit to every experience with intention so I can say yes to last-minute road trips, go scuba diving, or try new recipes. To me, showing up means being adaptable and open to new experiences. Whether in my work or personal life, I embrace challenges with curiosity. At the end of the day, work will always be there, but how you choose to see it makes all the difference.",Marketing,Business Development,Strategy,https://drive.google.com/open?id=1P_nx3cGVHLnNvQrhhITIN07iYeQlXMMh,"Instagram, Friend, Calapalooza",Asian (including Indian subcontinent and Philippines origin),,25.0,25.0

","I’m interested in ABA because of the unparalleled opportunities for both professional and personal growth. I began this recruitment process hoping to join a community that would help me evolve as a businesswoman, explore consulting, and serve as a fun social group. In the past few days of coffee chats and networking alone, I’ve gained so much insight into consulting, career exploration, and making the most of college. I can only imagine how much I would learn and grow if I were to become a member of ABA. More importantly, each and every person I’ve talked to has been incredibly genuine, making me feel comfortable being myself. I believe that finding a community like that (especially within a consulting club) is rare at Berkeley. I could truly see how each member embodied ABA’s values, showing the organization’s commitment to developing well-rounded business leaders and establishing a supportive community. 

What appeals to me most about ABA, though, is its industry-focused teams, which encourages members to specialize and gain hands-on experience in specific business sectors. This structure will help me develop expertise in a field of interest (NPO, strategy, marketing, etc.) while also providing clarity on my career direction. With 50 years of history, ABA’s vast alumni network and impressive project portfolio showcase its lasting impact on both its members and clients. Through my team experience, I want to make meaningful contributions to the clients we serve and ABA while growing professionally and personally. ","I best embody #GAIN&GIVE. Spending two years in school in Japan after living in America my whole life was truly transformative. Though I’m part Japanese, I had never fully immersed myself in the country’s culture beyond speaking broken Japanese with my mom or taking short trips to visit family. However, this experience allowed me to live daily life in Japan. Because I was young, the lessons I learned and the values I embraced stuck with me, shaping my passion for languages and cultural exchange.

In high school, I sought to give back what I had gained by founding a Japanese Culture Club. With the rising global popularity of Japanese entertainment, food, and travel, I wanted to create a space where students could meaningfully engage with Japanese culture. Through the club, I taught language lessons, organized cultural events, and mentored students interested in applying to colleges in Japan, fostering a community of shared learning.

Wanting to expand our impact, I also coordinated two of the district’s three community service events incorporating Japanese culture. Students folded origami cranes for the Children’s Peace Monument in Hiroshima and prepared over 200 onigiri rice balls for a local homeless shelter.

I believe in learning and giving back. By sharing my experiences and mentoring others, I upheld the spirit of #GAIN&GIVE.

Beyond building connections, I’m excited to learn from everyone in the club and grow both personally and professionally.

Much of my business experience revolves around market research, brand positioning, and go-to-market strategies. However, at ABA, I want to take a 180-degree turn and dive into the finance sector. As a statistics and economics major, I’m eager to deepen my understanding of finance—learning about valuation, investment strategies, and financial modeling. My goal at ABA is to develop a well-rounded business foundation, from fundamental analysis like market research and competitive strategy to more technical financial skills.

At Berkeley, I truly believe that everyone has the potential to achieve great things, but in the rush of academics, careers, and the future, many forget to slow down and just live in the moment. I believe in supporting others—whether it’s offering homework help, being a listening ear, or simply reminding friends to take a break and breathe.

My commitment to fostering a supportive community stems from my leadership experience as an Eagle Scout, where I led a troop of 60+ boys, ages 11-18. I guided younger scouts in developing leadership skills and life lessons while ensuring they had a strong sense of belonging through camping trips, volunteer projects, and fundraising efforts. Beyond leadership, I’ve always valued the importance of camaraderie. In the Business Careers in Entertainment Club, I was recognized with a superlative for being the most chill—not just for my laid-back attitude, but for always being someone others could rely on. Being surrounded by so many ambitious and talented individuals, people have so much going on in their lives, so whenever I get the chance, I offer a helping hand, whether it's assisting with a project, checking in on a friend, or just being there when someone needs support.

With so much going on in our lives, I believe in looking out for one another. I love asking people about their passions—whether it's entrepreneurship, music, Wall Street, or data analytics—because seeing others light up about what they love makes me happy too.

The quality of a TV show is deeply impacted by the process of greenlighting their seasons; whether a video game comes out rushed or polished is dependent on the marketing, product management, and strategy of their release. I got into tech to help my artistic friends and community by using my technical skills for good, and I want to try and explore the field of business for the same reason - giving a voice to those who are usually unheard in the terms of business.

After coffee chatting with six ABA members so far, I was beyond glad to find a collaborative, supportive culture with people that didn’t just work together but genuinely cared about one another. ABA is a club that cares not only about the work that you do but about the people that you do that work with. It’s a community I’d love to give back to, either becoming a PM in the future and leading my own team, or organizing the logistic side of the club in an exec role.

Organizing a full-fledged 3D pipeline production when you’re learning the pipeline yourself is difficult - we were laying the track right in front of the train and for almost ten weeks we knew that there was never any time to waste. But that didn’t mean that we didn’t have fun, and I took careful steps to make sure that happened: letting my team know exactly what each of our deliverables were so that we didn’t fall behind and become stressed, and meeting up on discord calls to chat and further build up our team. I really care about animation, and it meant the world to me to be creating that, but I also understood that at the end of the day, we’re all students who want to have a good time during our academic careers at Cal.

When we were finally able to premiere the short to our class during the end-of-semester showcase, I sat there in the audience surrounded not only by my colleagues, but by my friends.

Clubs: Business Review at Berkeley","Distinct from other Berkeley consulting clubs, ABA’s five different, structured projects provide ABA members with the unique opportunity to explore a variety of fields and professions. As a college student undecided about the field of my future career, I value and appreciate how ABA offers members the chance to learn about and gain experience in different industries, ultimately helping members to attain a more informed idea about the career direction they want to pursue. At the info session, I enjoyed hearing about Phillip’s transition from the Marketing to NPO team and Sharan’s journey from finance to business development before returning to finance. Talking to them highlighted ABA’s balance of structure and flexibility, allowing members to explore different professional fields while continuously growing within the club.

The team project provides members the opportunity to learn and develop professionally, but beyond the professional opportunities, the people behind the team are a community and family. As the only person from my school or city at Berkeley, I am eager and hoping to find a community of students that support, encourage, and push each other; I hope that community is ABA. Listening to Hilary share how an older ABA member was eager to sit with her at the library when she was a new member, and how she later formed bonds with newer members—including picking up her little—I truly felt the #ABALOVE that binds the ABA family; because of that, ABA is a community that I hope to join. ","I am best defined by the value of #BE. 

The summer before my senior year, I worked as a teaching assistant for The Math Movement, a NPO designed to teach foundational mathematics to middle school students in the Greater Cleveland area. I was paired with two rising sixth-graders, including Joccian, a student from East Cleveland—a municipality burdened by systemic inequities; the state ranks her school district, one that is facing teacher shortage, at one star in student achievement and progress. 

The five weeks I spent working with Joccian would not make up for her years of unequal educational opportunity. In our summer program, students were greeted by a multitude of teaching assistants ready to help, but two months later, when these middle school students would return to their school districts, these resources disappeared. The Math Movement aimed to help, and it did in part. Student test scores increased from the start of the program, but the program would not fix the achievement gap that has been prevalent in Greater Cleveland since the 1960s. How could it? The existence of deep-rooted inequality in the education system is not an issue that can be rectified within weeks. To address the inequality in classrooms, we need to concentrate on pervasive inequality in neighborhoods. Righting the achievement gap for the future will require a communal effort, but I hope that the time I spent with students helps them know that I will be a part of that effort, now and in the future.

If a team is too stiff, everything feels like a chore. If no one cares, the work turns into a mess. The best results happen when people actually enjoy what they’re doing.

For my Eagle Scout project, I had to build benches for a tennis court, which sounded simple until I actually started. Getting supplies was a nightmare, volunteers kept disappearing, and nothing ever went as planned. Some pieces were cut wrong, drills ran out of battery, and people got way too into playing with the power tools.

The ability to rotate between project groups is a rare opportunity that allows for both depth and breadth in consulting experiences. Every project seems to tie into something I want to explore, whether it’s strategy, finance, or tech-driven solutions, and I love the idea of being able to apply structured problem-solving across different industries.

Of course, you can’t ignore the high-caliber organizations and firms that ABA not only partners with but also sends members to. The network of mentors and alumni is unmatched, with people working at top consulting firms, investment banks, and tech companies. More importantly, ABA doesn’t just create connections—it actively prepares members through professional development, workshops, and hands-on projects. I’m eager to be challenged by smart, driven peers, refine my consulting toolkit, and learn from those who have navigated the same path I hope to follow.

Another thing that makes ABA stand out is its collaborative and inclusive culture. While some business orgs at Berkeley feel exclusive or competitive, ABA seems focused on building a community that helps each other succeed. I know ABA has hosted events like a business talent show to unite organizations, which speaks volumes about its values. Being part of a team that works hard but also supports each other is exactly the environment I want to grow in.","The ABA core value that I resonate with the most is Learn and Give Back. I’ve always believed that knowledge and skills are most impactful when shared, and I’ve dedicated much of my time to helping people who want to help themselves but lack the resources or opportunities to do so.

With iWin American English LLC, I created a platform to connect students in other countries with American teachers, starting with my own elementary teacher. Many of these students were eager to learn English to open doors for future opportunities but didn’t have access to affordable, quality instruction. Over time, iWin grew to provide 50+ classes with 18 teachers, giving students the tools they needed to achieve their goals.

Similarly, I founded FoodPlus after volunteering at a food bank and witnessing how much food went to waste while others went hungry. I built an app that connects event organizers with charities to redistribute surplus food. Thousands of meals have since been delivered, proving that a simple, accessible system can make a tangible difference in people’s lives.

In both projects, I learned valuable lessons about leadership, adaptability, and technology, but what’s mattered most is seeing how these efforts have helped others overcome challenges. ABA’s focus on using mentorship and skills to give back to the next generation perfectly matches my philosophy, and I’m excited about the opportunity to learn, grow, and continue making an impact alongside the ABA community.

Before attending the info session, I had heard how daunting the consulting club scene at Berkeley could be, and I wasn’t sure what to expect. But the moment I stepped into the ABA info session, my perspective completely changed. I was greeted by welcoming members, and all my nervousness faded. Instead of an intimidating environment, I found a group of people who were not only ambitious and driven but also kind, humble, and genuinely supportive.

As I spoke with different ABA members, I could see that this wasn’t just an organization, but a tight-knit community of people who uplift each other. Everyone I met was willing to share their experiences, offer advice, and engage in meaningful conversations. It felt less like a professional networking event and more like joining a group of close friends who challenge each other to grow and celebrate each other’s successes.

This balance of drive and humility is what makes ABA stand out to me. I want to be part of an organization that not only pushes me to become a better consultant, but also values authenticity, collaboration, and mentorship. ABA creates an environment where people are eager to learn, share knowledge, and grow together, and that’s exactly the kind of community I want to be a part of.","One of ABA’s core values that best describes me is #ABALOVE. Throughout my first semester at Berkeley, I’ve come to understand how challenging it can be, with academics, being away from hometown friends and family, and navigating an independent lifestyle, but having a supportive community makes all the difference. 

My past experience in my high school dance ensemble “Synergy” has given me the opportunity to demonstrate this value. Despite each member being dedicated to improving their dance skills, what truly made the experience meaningful was the sense of support we built as a team. We bonded through team events like Thanksgiving potlucks, Secret Santa gift exchanges, and annual banquets, which allowed us to create lifelong friendships through dance. Through our big-little system, I had the opportunity to both receive and provide guidance, whether it was related to choreography or not. During rehearsals, we constantly uplifted one another by offering choreography assistance, providing a helping hand during difficult routines, and cheering each other on at performances, football games, and basketball games. No matter the setting, we showed up for each other, whether that meant offering words of encouragement before stepping on stage or celebrating each other’s roles after an audition.

This experience has shaped me into someone who strongly values the community aspect of any organization I am a part of. I strive to create an environment where everyone feels supported, just as I have done in Synergy. I hope to bring this same spirit of support to ABA by helping others feel empowered and valued.

When I spoke to Landon and Sharan, one think kept coming up: community. It seems that ABA’s community really sets the club apart, and It’s one of the things I value most. If I’m going to work on projects every week with groups of people, it’s vital that we are tightly connected and have good chemistry, otherwise I wouldn’t enjoy the work. I’m also super interested in the five teams ABA offers, another feature that sets them apart. Personally, I want to join the finance team, and learn how to run the basic finances of a company. In high school I started a non profit organization and worked with multiple companies that wanted to sponsor us, which ignited the passion for finance, I just don’t have the technical skills to go into the field yet. Hopefully at ABA, I can find a community of like minded, hardworking individuals, who can teach me and push me every day to be a better person and professional.","ABA’s core value I resonate most with is #Be. Although it is characterized as one value, it represents humility, ambition, and tenacity. I believe these principals are vital for molding a perfect character, and a complete professional. Throughout my life, I have tried to maintain these standards. I have played team sports competitively since I was 10 years old, so I’ve always been able to learn from others. Whether it is a coach, or another teammate, I have always been coachable, never putting my ego above possibilities for improvement. I believe at every stage of life, there will be people better than you, and the only way to reach them is to learn from them. Now, I’m ready to be mentored by an ABA member, someone who objectively knows more about business than myself. In all my sports teams, I grew to eventually lead them as captain, and as I get mentored in ABA, I hope to rise to leadership roles such as a Project Manager, or even President. That brings me to be being ambitious, as I have always looked to take the next big step in my journey, such as being the student that ran for class president, and having enough ambition to win and provide a voice for the school. I was tireless and tenacious in pursuing these goals, which has led me to become a leader for others… something that I believe I can continue under the values of ABA.",Finance,Business Development,Strategy,https://drive.google.com/open?id=1DITJRbYkQNhFw8K-Lib46XmrYGSwjxHB,Friend,White,"No, just excited for the future!",28.0,28.0

Skydeck internship","I’m drawn to ABA for its vibrant culture and the diverse, talented community it fosters. Every interaction I’ve had with ABA members has reinforced that this is not just a group of brilliant individuals but also a supportive, driven, and genuinely kind community. The opportunity to collaborate with such inspiring peers in a team setting is what excites me most about ABA.

Beyond the culture, ABA aligns closely with my career aspirations. Its focus on marketing, strategy, and nonprofit consulting provides the ideal environment for me to grow both personally and professionally while exploring different areas of business. I’m particularly excited by the caliber of projects ABA takes on—strategy with Google, marketing with Microsoft, and nonprofit work with the WHO. The opportunity to tackle real-world challenges for industry leaders and make meaningful contributions is incredibly motivating.

Through ABA, I hope to build meaningful relationships while honing my professional skill set. I’m eager to learn from my peers and mentors, contribute to impactful projects, and develop hands-on experience in a supportive and dynamic environment.","The ABA core value that resonates most with me is #BE: Be Humble, Be Ambitious, and Be Tenacious.

My ambition has always driven me to set high goals, from aspiring to attend Berkeley to constantly pushing myself beyond my comfort zone. It gave me the confidence to pursue a challenging path, and that drive ultimately got me here. However, my time at Berkeley has been a humbling experience. Surrounded by incredibly talented and accomplished peers, I quickly realized that no matter how much I achieve, there is always more to learn and room to grow.

Yet, this humility fuels my ambition. Seeing my peers excel has been incredibly motivating—it pushes me to keep improving, set higher goals, and strive to be the best version of myself.

Tenacity has been at the core of my journey. I wasn’t admitted to my dream schools out of high school, so I started at community college. Even there, I faced setbacks, getting turned down for internships and opportunities. But rejection never broke me; it only made me work harder. In just one year, I transferred to Berkeley, proving my resilience and drive. Getting here was just the beginning—now, I’m more determined than ever to embrace challenges, learn from those around me, and make the most of every opportunity.",Strategy,Marketing,NPO,https://drive.google.com/open?id=1RHwpvjpXprGiVfyOQ6e_Zb0rQGTXmq-l,"Instagram, Handbill/Flyer, Friend, Calapalooza",Asian (including Indian subcontinent and Philippines origin),,27.0,27.0

ABA presents an incredible opportunity to explore different industries through hands-on experience and real-world client projects. I would love to be a part of a community full of people equally passionate about business and dedicated to both personal and professional growth. 

Through my team experience, I hope to develop both technical and soft skills, including conducting surveys, presenting decks, and analyzing data. More importantly, I hope to gain a deeper understanding into various industries by collaborating closely with my team and learning from real-world applications. My first choice, the Finance Committee, particularly interests me since I’ve always been drawn to the money management side of business. I believe this team will provide me with the foundational knowledge and resources to begin my journey into that field. Additionally, the Business Development Committee would allow me to explore product management, and the Marketing Committee offers a unique intersection of creativity and data-driven strategy — both of which align with my interest. 

To me, what truly sets ABA apart is its welcoming and supportive culture. From speaking with members, I can already tell that this is a club where I will be challenged to grow, surrounded by a community that encourages both ambition and collaboration. I am eager to learn, contribute, and become part of a team that will help me develop not just as a businesswoman, but as an individual.
","The ABA core value that best describes me is #BE, as I actively strive to become the best version of myself. 

I embody humility, believing that there is always more to learn. I find immense value in listening to others’ perspectives, as personal stories provide invaluable lessons that textbooks simply can’t replicate. Whether in the classroom or in everyday conversations, I make an effort to learn from those around me. I wouldn’t be where I am today without the mentors and friends who have shaped my journey, and I aim to carry that same mindset forward in every space I enter. 

At the same time, I’m ambitious, constantly seeking new challenges and expanding my interests. While I’m studying business, I love exploring how other disciplines complement my field of study, such as understanding how politics shape markets, how ad psychology influences consumers, or even how design principles enhance marketing strategies. With more hobbies than I can count, I find joy in pushing the boundaries of my knowledge.

Lastly, I am tenacious, unafraid to try new things even when success isn’t guaranteed. Having competitively danced throughout high school, I understand the importance of showing up everyday to practice ready to put in my best effort. That same mentality drives me in everything I do, whether it’s tackling a difficult project, learning a new skill, or stepping outside of my comfort zone.

I look forward to representing #BE at ABA, where I can continue to learn and grow alongside this wonderful community.

","ABA’s commitment to blending social impact with practical strategy through the NPO team really reflects what I’d like to do in my career, long-term. As a CS major interested in environmental economics and policy, I’d like to bridge my technical background with real-world impact through the club. ABA’s varied team experience also really interests me—especially Marketing and Finance. Elsewhere on campus, I work on the Finance committee of an organization designed to help girls in computer science, and I believe ABA is the right place to continue developing those skills via varied cases.

While speaking to other ABA members with similar interests and backgrounds, however, I realized the club’s biggest draw for me is both its concentration on business—and the people. I’ve been on many different teams in my life, ranging from robotics to my research at Berkeley to high school soccer. While their focuses have differed widely, their common thread has always been the people who I worked with, played with, and laughed with. ABA’s members seem to be on that same wavelength—caring about the planet, working to save it, and enjoying the process. My conversations with ABA members tended to span both the professional and the personal, which strikes the ideal balance for me. In short, I think ABA is the place where I can help save the planet and have fun with the people I'm doing it with.","#INIT2GETHER reflects me best because I strongly believe in the value–-even necessity—of collaboration. Last semester, I worked on a project with a partner nonprofit organization in Valparaiso, Chile, called Tukuypaj, an education and therapy nonprofit focused on helping autistic children—in Spanish. My team and I were tasked with building a gamified learning app that both the therapists and their students could use.

To me, making an impact means really listening to the people you are working with. Over several calls with the nonprofit’s director and Tukuypaj therapists, I came to understand the major issue: the center had difficulty capturing children’s attention spans while they were studying. 

I grew up speaking Spanish, and although I had never used it for a project before, it quickly became essential to communication with the nonprofit. The feedback from Tukuypaj’s therapists guided my direction for the entire project, eventually resulting in a gameplay with bright colors and sound effects to hold attention well. 

Although the app is small and specific, I believe that it did make a real impact on the Tukuypaj community—because it was guided by them. Communication in collaboration remains pivotal for everything I do, because only by really hearing someone can you know how best to help them.",NPO,Finance,Marketing,https://drive.google.com/open?id=19FfODRqerbJ3F2ugx_IGUAQQJ6UNMQ9x,Friend,"Asian (including Indian subcontinent and Philippines origin), Middle Eastern",,28.0,28.0

STEMsters ","I am excited to join ABA because of its welcoming mentors, close-knit community, and the opportunity to meet more genuinely cool people. After meeting ABA members while tabling I was immediately surprised by how friendly and approachable everyone was. Speaking with members (Philip, Hillary, Gina, and Chloe just to name a few!) over coffee chats and at social events I was convinced that I would feel comfortable at ABA. I did not feel any pressure or discomfort as I did with other groups because ABA’s community was so friendly and genuinely down to earth. Because of this it was easy for me to be myself and feel welcomed to participate in activities. Through joining a team at ABA, I hope to gain a more in-depth knowledge of different aspects of consulting and refine important skills like public speaking, data analysis, and leadership. I am particularly interested in ABA’s NPO team and the opportunity to work on meaningful projects with non-profit organizations such as the World Health Organization. I am most fulfilled when I am able to help others and I'm very passionate about spending my time working on initiatives which promote positive change. Overall, I am eager to develop my skills in order to make an impact in improving the world. I hope to be able to become part of such a supportive environment like ABA where I can grow professionally while also getting the opportunity to become friends with so many cool people. ","To me, the value of ABA Love really resonates because I feel it captures the experience of being part of an inclusive community where nobody is left out. ABA love means that members can rely on each other not only in a professional setting but also are close enough to support each other personally. In my past teams, I have always promoted a positive space and environment. For example, at STEMsters I planned fun group bonding activities every month for my team of officers. Whether it was coordinating trips to the Glendale Galleria or having an afternoon boba run, I made sure to promote a culture where we didn't just work together but also could rely on each other as friends. In addition to promoting a caring culture in my teams, I have always put in the effort to be there for others on a personal level. This was especially true in environments such as my high school, which was super competitive, leading people to feel isolated or burnt out often. I would always try my best to stay positive and would check up on friends who were not doing as well. I wanted to make sure that even in such a stressful environment, my friends felt that they had someone to lean on. From these experiences, I believe ABA Love best describes me, and I really connect with the value. I believe that the importance placed on caring for one another is what makes ABA so unique, and I hope to see more of it!",NPO,Marketing,Business Development,https://drive.google.com/open?id=110c_qw88BbIqzodGl_TO95PpmzeRdeH5,"Instagram, Friend",Asian (including Indian subcontinent and Philippines origin),,28.0,28.0

My passion for business stems mainly from my mother, who left the corporate world to establish her own thriving interior design business. Her courage, ambition, and ability to transform her visions into reality has inspired me to apply my education to the business sector. Throughout high school I have witnessed her navigate challenges, like breast cancer, and still have the power to build a successful enterprise. I believe ABA is the perfect environment to support my ambitions and provide me with a platform to grow both personally and professionally.


Beyond professional development, I want to be a part of a tightly-knit social group who all work well together. I truly value teamwork and a strong community and I look forward to collaborating with driven individuals who share similar goals as my own. I hope ABA will not only challenge me to step outside of my comfort zone but also build lasting friendships and memories along the way. 


Through ABA, I aim to develop the skills, relationships, and confidence needed to achieve my career aspirations while contributing to ABA’s vibrant culture.  ","Of ABA’s five core values, I resonate most with #InItT2Gether: Success Through Collaboration. Running, lifting, and sports in general have always been the core of who I am. In high school I was a three-time state and one-time national champion in track and field. Outside the classroom I spent practically all of my time on the track or in the gym. From being the smallest freshman on the team to captain my junior and senior year, this experience taught me every role on a team has an impact.

Running breakdown 400’s three to four times a week was honestly one of the worst experiences. For those of you who aren’t familiar with track, I won’t even attempt to explain it, it’s just awful. But running ‘til I couldn’t feel my legs in the presence of people I truly cared about made it all the better. I had been running with many of my teammates since before middle school and playing basketball with my other teammates since elementary school. We spent hours together every day, becoming so close that it felt strange when we all went to our respective universities, some competing at the D1 level and some not (me, a now NARP).

Because of this, I feel like my resume lacks ‘character’ or true ‘business experience.’

Though I don’t have much consulting or professional experience, I do know what it takes to accomplish common goals and work as a team. Whether it was playing my rival school on senior night or running in my last state championship, I always understood a smile on my face would bring me across that finish line quicker than any of the countless days spent training and conditioning. Through sports, I learned that genuinely enjoying who you do things with will always be more important than what you’re actually doing.

I mentioned that one of the clubs I was interested in from Calapalooza was Berkeley ABA. To my surprise, Nia was a member of ABA and she was excited to share her experience with me. Like Nia, I’m not 100% sure what I want to do in the future. Nia told me about how ABA has allowed her to explore different career options that appeal to her. Indeed, at the interest meeting, I learned that most members end up switching teams each term to try out the plethora of roles ABA offers. From my team experience, I hope to learn more about each role and gauge my interest in each of the departments. I was also pleased with how open everyone was at the interest meeting too. When I told members that I was an Industrial Engineering major, people immediately told me about Will and how I should talk to him. The collaborative spirit and culture in Berkeley ABA make me want to be a member of the club. Above all that, I also want to be in an organization that values having fun. The emphasis on putting the best work forward and throwing the best parties and events is something I find very important. Small things like the club members answering my ""what animal would ABA be"" icebreaker in creative ways and them cheering for each other when they revealed their roles make Berkeley ABA stand out to me as a club. ","JSE – just serious enough. When I ended up at ABA’s booth, I remember talking to a member about the just serious enough principle. Like ABA, I’ve always stood by the principle “work hard, play hard.” Back in high school, I was president of FBLA and leading up to our competitive season, people would be busy studying and working on their projects and I noticed that many of the members seemed very stressed out and overworked. With the past culture of our branch of FBLA being very “work hard always,” I knew that we needed a change. After all, just like Paul said at the Fall interest meeting “we only have one college {high school} experience.” With the remaining bits of our club’s budget, we planned a trip to Busch Gardens and an eating competition at one of Orlando’s best dining – Crazy Buffet. It was through these two experiences that made our club morale increase tenfold, and we ended up placing the best at states in our school’s history. Today, my school’s branch of FBLA continues to emphasize the JSE principle with big social and trips (this year to Universal) and our club has drawn in many new members interested in joining Eastside’s FBLA family.",Strategy,Business Development,NPO,https://drive.google.com/open?id=19LjpPWdtD1K4SA9AgFoHPNhtIDb5iFAD,"Friend, Calapalooza",Asian (including Indian subcontinent and Philippines origin),,28.0,26.0

ABA embodies the values a finance career demands in requiring members to uphold a certain quality in their work and prove that they have done their research with focus, attention, and accuracy. In addition to the educational programs ABA provides, allowing members to rotate between the different teams by reapplying each semester sharpens overall consulting ability, exposing one to viewpoints they otherwise wouldn’t have considered.

Throughout my work at ABA, I intend to bring a new perspective to issues I acquired as a result of my extensively multicultural background and education. Combining my strong interest for the startup space and particularly venture capital, I hope to, given the opportunity, consult on a project in the finance team.

","As an international student who lived in Qatar, I resonate with the community aspect of ABA. With a strong gravitation toward the entrepreneurial space, I appreciate that the rest of the world is not as straightforward in business as the United States. Back home, it was evident that individuals who attempted to establish a small non-profit or business aimed at providing the community with a service often faced obstacles that were not immediately resolvable. There was a clear lack of knowledge amongst the youth particularly concerning how to overcome these early stage challenges, ranging anything from registering a company name to obtaining a commercial license.

After speaking to fellow peers who faced similar challenges, we decided to address this very issue and launch TalkQatar, a finance based podcast with the sole mission of empowering the youth with entrepreneurial knowledge through meaningful conversations with leaders in the field. One of our very first episodes was with a CEO who launched a sports academy, eventually growing it to one of the biggest in the country and significantly contributing to increased exercise awareness for the Qatari youth. During the conversation, the founder discussed many of the early challenges he faced, particularly relating to obtaining approval and business licenses, sharing lessons he wished he had known prior to launching the organization. As our viewership increased, we sought to redefine our mission and centralize it to our content; put simply, we tried to level the playing field with each new episode, aiming to cover many of the sectors one may attempt to venture into.

As a Data Science major with experience in both technical and business domains through courses like UGBA 135 and various business programming classes at Saddleback College, I'm excited by the opportunity to apply these skills to real-world business challenges while working alongside passionate peers.
What particularly excites me about ABA is its emphasis on both professional development and community building. My experience leading multiple organizations, from CyberPatriot Club to InterSTEM, has shown me the value of combining technical expertise with strong interpersonal connections. I look forward to not just analyzing data but also building meaningful relationships through ABA's social events and team projects.
During my internship at JenaValve Technologies, I worked with clinical data analysis and electronic data capture systems, giving me a foundation in translating data insights into business value. At ABA, I hope to expand these skills while learning from diverse perspectives within the team. The opportunity to work on consulting projects while developing both analytical and soft skills in a supportive environment makes ABA the perfect place for my growth.
","The core value that best describes me is ""Growth Mindset."" Throughout my academic and leadership experiences, I've consistently sought opportunities to learn and adapt, even in challenging situations. As President of the CyberPatriot Club, I not only learned complex Windows and Linux systems but also taught these concepts to new members. This experience demonstrated my commitment to both personal growth and helping others develop their skills.
My internship at Waterlily Planning further illustrates this mindset. When faced with inefficient data management processes, I took the initiative to learn new tools like Google Apps Script, GPT, and PhantomBuster to create automated workflow solutions. Rather than being intimidated by unfamiliar technologies, I embraced the challenge as an opportunity to expand my skillset.
Additionally, my role as Head of Technology at InterSTEM required constantly adapting to new technical challenges while collaborating with the board on various initiatives. This experience taught me that growth isn't just about individual development but also about lifting others up and creating an environment where everyone can thrive. This aligns perfectly with ABA's collaborative approach to learning and development.

The opportunity to work on a semester-long consulting project for a Fortune 500 company excites me because it’s not just theoretical—it’s real strategy, real execution, and real results. I want to refine my ability to break down business problems, conduct market research, and develop insights that drive meaningful change.

Beyond the projects, the Analyst Development Program stands out as a structured way to build technical and strategic thinking skills. From Excel modeling to case analysis, ABA provides the resources to develop a strong consulting foundation while applying those skills directly to real-world problems.

But what truly sets ABA apart is its culture of excellence. Everyone I’ve met is ambitious and driven, yet collaborative in how they approach challenges. It’s rare to find a team that consistently works at such a high level while staying grounded in humility and integrity. I want to surround myself with people who push me to think sharper, execute better, and never settle for surface-level solutions. ABA is where I know I can grow, contribute, and make an impact.","Growth happens in the space between humility and ambition—between knowing there’s always more to learn and refusing to settle for anything less than excellence. That balance defines how I approach every challenge.

When I revived my school’s Science Olympiad team, I didn’t walk in thinking I had all the answers. I listened, learned what worked and what didn’t, and studied how top teams operated. But learning wasn’t enough—execution mattered. I restructured training, streamlined budgeting, and built a culture of preparation. By the end of the year, we had doubled in size and secured top placements.

That same mindset pushed me in Model UN. I started out struggling to speak in front of a room. Instead of shying away, I studied the best delegates, analyzed what made them effective, and forced myself to improve. Eventually, I wasn’t just competing—I was leading committees, navigating high-pressure negotiations, and winning awards at top conferences like NAIMUN.

The lesson? Never think you’ve made it, but never let that stop you from pushing forward. #BE is about setting high standards, staying relentless in pursuit of growth, and remembering that every success starts with the humility to learn. That’s the mindset I bring to everything I do.",Strategy,Business Development,Finance,https://drive.google.com/open?id=1jVeUcP3SqN6K5OYKaMeeECVjMpSoWj-U,Friend,Asian (including Indian subcontinent and Philippines origin),,28.0,28.0

	First, I want to gain professional experience that will enhance my workplace value by teaching me valuable skills to carry into future work environments. I am searching for consulting opportunities that allow me to provide advice through direct engagement with companies. I have had experience with both newly-founded and nonprofit organizing, so the Business development and NPO consulting project teams at ABA instantly attracted my interest. I am confident that ABA will equip me with business skills and knowledge that will bolster my professional arsenal, regardless of which team(s) I end up working with. The case workshop your team hosted was a prime example of the professional experience ABA possesses, and can pass down to their incoming members. I have learned that your organization is prepared to provide productive assistance to businesses that they collaborate with, and I want to join a community that shares this mindset.
	This leads to my second goal, which is to find a tight-knit community of like-minded individuals. I have found that Berkeley provides so many different professional opportunities, but when engaging with the individuals at ABA, I saw that this could also come with the unique opportunity to make friends. I want to continue to utilize and develop my social and professional skills during my time at Berkeley, so I think I would thrive in the environment ABA creates. I hope to find a community of friends that share my same ambition for personal growth.","The ABA core value that best describes me is “#GAIN&GIVE”
	 I have played soccer my whole life and after everything the sport has given me, I take every opportunity I can to give back to my soccer community. I volunteer at Play Higher FC, a non profit organization run through the local Saddleback Church. I had been playing soccer with this organization for several years, forming invaluable relationships with coaches and fellow players. This inclusive environment provided so much learning and growth, thus it is a pleasure to volunteer my time helping the next generation. Teaching younger players sportsmanship, dedication, collaboration, and other imperative lessons gives me purpose within the community. Providing the same opportunity to others that I have experienced is a privilege. Being a volunteer coach at the Boys and Girls Club and for recreational soccer teams has reinforced this belief. 
	I also resonate with this core value through my relationship with the ocean. One of my favorite activities is surfing, and I love to spend time at the beach. During the summer, I work at a beach camp to share my love for the ocean with children while teaching ocean safety and bodyboard/surf skills. Unfortunately, the local beaches in my hometown have been exposed to significant amounts of pollution. I was part of the Blue Oceans Club in highschool that organized cleanup efforts to preserve the local beaches. I have gained so much through my relationship with my soccer community and the ocean, so these experiences have allowed me to give back.",Business Development,NPO,Finance,https://drive.google.com/open?id=1VLBb3dtmWUCOgYOYjwY3SvheLpPoYTW4,"Instagram, Friend",White,,29.0,28.0

I have a unique insight into ABA and had the opportunity to meet several ABA members early in the fall semester. The members shared their club experiences and offered valuable advice beyond the club, navigating both the academic and social aspects of college life. Despite our brief meeting, I felt a connection with them and wanted to get involved with ABA. On top of this, my brother was in ABA for the past two years and has spoken highly about his time with the club. These perspectives showed me that not only does ABA have a growth mindset and pursuit of excellence but also because it carries prestige at Cal and beyond. 
By joining the ABA team, I hope to gain firsthand knowledge of working directly with a client (the dos and don’ts), learning new roles and responsibilities, and engage with a diverse group of peers to address business problems. Being in a team filled with individuals of different skill set would challenge me to think more critically and refine my soft skills. Beyond personal growth, I’m excited to be part of a supportive and dynamic community where I can both contribute to and learn from my teammates. 
","The ABA core value of “Just Serious Enough” resonates with me because it captures the balance between professionalism and personal growth. During my freshman fall semester, I faced the challenge of balancing academics with my social life, which, while demanding, was incredibly fulfilling. It pushed me to manage my time effectively, ensuring I could handle my coursework  while still having time with my friends. This experience taught me the importance of maintaining both aspects of my life. As a college student the motto “Work hard, play hard” has been a principle I have tried to balance, reminding me that academic success and professional growth are just as important as maintaining a healthy social life. This balance has played a key role in shaping my work ethic and resilience.

","Within the first few minutes of ABA’s official website, I was immediately drawn to the mission statement, which ultimately solidified my interest in joining the club. While many organizations use buzzwords to promote themselves, it’s easy to tell when they’re being authentic or not. As I scrolled through ABA’s page, what stood out to me was their commitment to fostering well-rounded business leaders, a goal I aspire to achieve. As ABA""s  ""About Us"" page highlights their values: ""humility, integrity, and passion for each other and the work we do,"" these values align with my own personal principles, as I firmly believe they are essential for producing meaningful work and building a strong team connection. It’s important for me to be part of a group that strives for excellence, while also upholding ethical standards, and having fun, which is exactly what ABA embodies.

While it was the website that initially drew me in, it was the info sessions that cemented the club's true culture. Throughout the in-person events, it became clear that the members of the club are not just professional peers to one another, rather they are a community of friends. This is what I hope to gain from this experience, not only for professional growth or to refine my problem-solving skills, but to be a part of a community that cares for one another. While it is inevitable to avoid problems in the projects we face, I hope to work with my team through all the difficulties as we struggle together.","Within ABA’s five core values, the one that best describes me is “In It Together.” Growing up, I was an extremely shy student at an academically competitive school district. This ultimately gave me the assumption that everyone around me had it all figured out as they learned so effortlessly, leading me to hesitate more and speak up less. 

Things began to change during my junior year in English as Socratic seminars became a usual. Initially, I dreaded those discussions and would find every excuse not to go to class, but over time I eventually became more accustomed as I started to force myself to go. In one seminar, I noticed a classmate across the circle, visibly shaking and having difficulty contributing to the discussion, as those who were more vocal kept interrupting. Seeing their discomfort reminded me of how daunting it is to speak up. Instead of focusing on my own points, I decided to try and make space for them. As I asked them for their opinion trying to create a comfortable environment overall, leading to them becoming a bit more vocal through the discussion.

As I continue to grow, I try to remind myself about the difficulties that I’ve had within the past and that there are people who are still in that same position. Whether it is a discussion or a team setting, I always try to make a point to try and amplify those voices who might find it challenging to speak up, acknowledging how crucial it is to feel supported and heard.",Marketing,NPO,Business Development,https://drive.google.com/open?id=1JUxeDUtTHEF3yZrcaE9o0rwQLAETSdqk,Friend,Asian (including Indian subcontinent and Philippines origin),"I am a sophomore transfer, implying that I transferred a year earlier than my intended year, but I will be staying at UC Berkeley until 2027 to finish my double major degree.

More specifically, its focus on learning heavily ties in with my personality, as I am someone who genuinely enjoys learning and tackling challenges no matter the focus, as I find happiness in doing just that. Furthermore, mentorship, the other side of the coin, is just as important, as passing down knowledge and giving back is the key to learning in the first place. I believe I have embodied this value in this past through several of my experiences, especially in the pursuit of learning and knowledge, as just in my first two semesters at Berkeley, I joined two research labs, building upon my technical knowledge as well as communication in the professional world, additionally taking on the role of a Propulsion Engineer for SEB, a challenge that required me to be humble and open to a whole new world of technical skills. Furthermore, in regards to mentorship and giving back, these two aspects of ABA have always been something I strive to do myself, which I have done this past semester through helping several younger high-school friends with their college applications and process.

As a young, dreamy-eyed basketball player, my dad quickly squashed the dream. He did, however, drop a piece of sage advice: “If you want to be around the NBA, go into business.” From that moment, my interest in business, specifically sports management, took shape, and a long-term goal of breaking into that field was born.

Through conversations with members of Berkeley’s many business clubs, I realized that consulting is the perfect path toward sports management, providing strategic thinking, analytical skills, and professional business development necessary to succeed in that industry. Among Berkeley’s consulting groups, ABA immediately stood out as the ideal place to gain hands-on experience working with top companies and refining problem-solving skills. The emphasis on learning through projects aligns perfectly with my desire to gain exposure to real-world business operations and develop a consultant’s mindset. I’ve seen firsthand how ABA can shape careers, and if given the opportunity, I am eager to learn, contribute, and apply my skills in a fast-paced, collaborative environment.

Beyond career development, ABA’s strong culture of mentorship and community quickly attracted me. The strength of ABA’s alumni network speaks volumes about the club’s ability to foster both professional and personal growth, striking the perfect balance between working hard and making the most of the college experience.

Ultimately, through ABA, I hope to develop the skills and relationships that will help me succeed in consulting after graduation but also propel me toward my childhood goal of breaking into the NBA through business.
","ABA’s Gain & Give value resonates with me most because I believe in learning from those who came before me and using that knowledge to uplift the next generation. This philosophy has shaped my experiences, particularly through my involvement with the San Fernando Valley Japanese Community Center.

As a child, the community center was a refuge, a place to learn basketball in a welcoming environment, uplifted by compassionate and dedicated volunteer coaches and surrounded by peers with similar backgrounds and experiences.

When the opportunity arose to become a volunteer coach for their summer basketball clinic, I seized it eagerly. It was a full-circle moment, a chance for me to pay forward the love and inspiration I had received during my formative years. For 5 summers, I could be found at the community center bright and early lowering the hoops for the incoming kids. I ran them through drills, watching their faces light up, as they honed their skills dribbling through cones and making layups. Off the court, I volunteered at annual community events, helping to facilitate meaningful connections among kids who, like me, found belonging through basketball.

Through these experiences, I have come to understand that true growth is a cycle—we learn from those who guide us, and in turn, we pass that knowledge forward. I am excited about the opportunity to join ABA, where I can continue to gain valuable consulting experience while giving back by mentoring and uplifting those who come after me, just as I was once uplifted.

Work Study","I’m interested in ABA because of the potential to learn and grow in business. Firstly, I’d grow my business skillset and repietoire. As a finance consultant, I’d be learning fundamental skills I’ll need in my future job through the ABA teaching sessions. I’d also learn how to work with cases working on real-world problems.  I’ve taken most breadths before Berkeley, so I have all the room in the world for every finance class and consulting class. I realized the best way to learn business is through real consulting. I realized its a crucial step for me to join a consulting club that takes business and their projects with a grind mentality, also one that has a lot of fun along the way.  
Adding on, I’d benefit from an alumni network that would help me realize what career my skills cater to. As of now, I’m the type of person to open hundreds of internet tabs to find answers. In a strong alumni base, I’d better understand what I need to achieve my goals. And after that, I’d definitely be open-arms for future ABA members to look to.
Lastly, I’m most interested in ABA for the community. Through watching you guys interact with each other in multiple info sessions, I can tell ABA is a place of comfort and a good time. Although other clubs say it, ABA does seem like a home away from home. Simply put, I’d love to join a tight-knit community of diverse interests and backgrounds. ","The value I most resonate with is “Take Care of Each Other”. I connected with the blurb a lot. Coming from a not as academically driven high school in the suburbs of Minnesota to Berkeley was challenging. Less people truly knew me, and the competition and drive of students at Berkeley added to the hard adjustment. I felt immediately the importance of having people who care for you at all times. I am fortunate now to have made quality friends at Berkeley that I know care about me. I also hope to be the empathic and caring friend for others.
An experience of mine that demonstrates this value was my friend going through a mix of troubles from a breakup, not succeeding in classes, and more. I felt the need to prioritize his emotions over any task I had that day. I feel like studying time can always be compensated, whether thats staying up or working harder. So that day, I ended up just going out with him and being able to talk to him which he said helped a lot.

Professional development, alumni network, weekend retreats, fortune 500 clients. Sitting through coffee chats hearing the same script over and over again is tiring. But ABA was different. The conversations weren't about what ABA could do for me but rather about establishing real human connections. Walking into info sessions and case workshops, I could tell I was stepping into a room full of sharpened knives, where people weren't afraid to think critically, push back and expect more from one another. 

That's what drew me in. Not only did everyone's ambition stand out but also the way they all carried themselves. No one felt the need to oversell the club to me because they know their work speaks for itself. They didn't try to impress me; they were just genuinely excited about what they were doing and were eager to share. The energy felt real and that's exactly the type of environment where I thrive. 

I want to leave ABA thinking faster, working sharper and holding myself to a higher standard than ever before. The real value isn't just in the skills I'll gain but in the people who will challenge me, the pressure that will refine me and the friendships that will last long after projects are due. I crave a space filled with like-minded individuals who are obsessed with getting better everyday and I know I'll find that in ABA.","I've never had the luxury of standing still. When my father was arrested during fourth grade, I became the glue holding my family together. When money became tight in middle school, I built an online business—not because I had a grand vision, but to ease my mom's stress which often left me feeling nauseous. Whether in business or life, I've learned that tenacity isn't about having all the answers but rather about adapting, outworking uncertainty and pushing forward even when nothing is promised. 

As glue, I've learned that ambition without humility is just noise and real success comes from knowing when to lead, when to listen and when to put your head down and outwork everyone else. Starting my first business at a young age taught me that failure isn't personal, it's just information. Information that I use as my fertilizer to grow. And I've applied this mindset to every challenge I've ever faced—whether budgeting every dollar to keep my business alive, working as a chef since my mom had to do overtime or teaching myself how to count cards after losing too many hands in poker, I've always put in the necessary work to be the very best that I could. 

#BE defines how I approach life. I've never waited for opportunities, I seek out the hardest challenges, knowing they'll shape me into someone sharped, stronger and more capable.

I discovered that ambition and humility can coexist when I served as vice president of the computer science club at my university. I encouraged participants to speak out, discuss ideas, and even teach me new things instead of acting as though I knew everything when I led coding courses. I created an atmosphere where everyone felt appreciated by being modest.

At the same time, my desire pushed me to set ambitious objectives, such as planning hackathons and networking gatherings that attracted industry speakers, sponsors, and mentors. Organizing those events wasn't always simple; occasionally, we had last-minute modifications or practical challenges. But tenacity came into play at that point. Together, we would overcome obstacles and emerge stronger.

Through it all, I came to understand that true leadership is about supporting one another and fostering growth rather than merely reaching goals. My attitude to cooperation has been formed by the ""we"" over ""I"" mentality, which also motivates me to go above and beyond.

Learning, for me, has been not only about gaining knowledge but also about using those skills to empower others and help push them forward. A key experience was my work at a nonprofit organization that aimed at supporting low income families, refugees, immigrants, and the elderly. This nonprofit was also a vital resource for my family during tough times, helping us navigate employment, academics, and life. This experience provided insights that I would have never been able to access, ultimately transforming both my life and mindset. Volunteering at the same nonprofit allowed me to help others access the same resources and guidance that had a profound impact on me and my family. Through this particular experience, I saw the power of teaching others and realized that the true value of knowledge lies in its ability to help empower others to succeed.

This is why the #GAIN&GIVE value speaks to me deeply as it mirrors my own journey of learning, growing, and helping others gain what I have received.

After coffee chatting with multiple members and going to info sessions/events, I found everyone to be motivated, passionate, and kind. The networking portion of the first info session felt incredibly welcoming. That sort of atmosphere only comes from genuine connection and love from within the club. Everyone was so uplifting and really cared about each other, something I really value. 
      Beyond the social aspect, I hope to use ABA as a space to slowly narrow down my field of interest and find my niche. All the projects offer exposure to different industries, and I’m excited to explore various areas while also improving my overall skillset. As of now, my main interest lies in the intersection of business and technology, particularly product design in biotech. I hope to learn more about project management and working together with others on professional assignments with real implications.  
      In high school, it was really difficult to “fill out” my application with activities because they were all disingenuous. I want ABA to be different. Working in a team with like-minded individuals and trusting others to do good work for a final, great result will be a breakthrough for me. Finally, something I worked so hard on will have an impact on someone or something. 
      Finally, I believe that the connections I can make while being in ABA will be invaluable. I will get to know people across industries and career paths that will help me grow professionally and personally.  More than just networking, I’m excited to be a part of a community that challenges and inspires me. 
","#JSE
      My proudest moments come from tirelessly working towards a goal - while making sure to laugh along the way. To me, there’s nothing more fulfilling than pushing through long hours of work with a group of friends, laughing at random things, and coming out stronger as a team. Whether it was leading my marching band section through competition season or working on long homework assignments, I found that the best and most genuine work happens when people love what they’re doing. 
      As a section leader, I wasn’t the type to tell or micromanage. Instead, I ensured that my section had everything they needed to succeed - and that they actually wanted to be there. It took some time, but my main goal at the start of the season was to get my section to love the sport as much as I did. Slowly but surely, pre-competition rituals, inside jokes, and random tangents in between rehearsals became all the reason to show up. We built a section that worked hard because we cared. By the end of the season, we weren’t just a high performing band; we were a massive circle of friends who truly loved what we were doing. 
     That’s the kind of energy I bring to every team I’m a part of. I strongly believe the best teams work hard and have fun, and I absolutely love being the person who brings that balance. To me, “Just Serious Enough” isn’t just a cliche phrase - it’s the mindset that drives me in everything I do.

I see myself starting out on the finance team because I’m looking to pursue a career in finance. I hope to be able to use the technical skills that I learned from Berkeley Finance Club and really apply it to a hands-on project. ABA’s Analyst Development Program stands out to me as an opportunity to build essential skills and explore different areas of business in a structured yet flexible way. With five different teams, I’m excited to gain exposure to various aspects of business and find the best fit for me, knowing I’ll have the support of ABA every step of the way. I think that the strategic thinking that I’ll develop will provide a strong foundation for understanding the financial side of business–whether that’s analyzing investments or shaping financial strategies. The opportunity to gain hands-on experience across different fields, while being part of such a close-knit and supportive network, is something that truly excites me. Knowing that both alumni and current members are there to mentor and guide me makes ABA feel like more than just an organization–it’s a long-term investment in my career and personal growth. It’s this combination of professional development and meaningful relationships that makes me eager to be a part of ABA. ","Of ABA’s five core values, “Success Through Collaboration” (#InIt2gether) resonates with me the most. I believe real success isn’t achieved on your own–it happens when people come together, share ideas, and push each other to excel. I work better in environments where collaboration fields innovation, and in my experience, I find that the best outcomes come from a collective effort. As co-captain of my Moot Court team, I led my team in analyzing legal arguments. While I was in a leadership role, our success wasn’t about individual contributions–it was about working together, analyzing cases as a group, and learning from each other’s perspectives. We functioned as a unit, much like ABA’s philosophy that even though leadership might feel unnatural at first, everyone must own their part of the project. My research role at Caltech’s SHArK Lab further enforced this idea. While conducting research on sustainable energy, I worked alongside postgrads and my peers each taking charge of a different part of the project. Beyond academics, my experience as captain of my high school basketball team has taught me even more about teamwork. I know when to take charge, but I also know when to pass the ball–literally and figuratively. To me collaboration isn’t just about working with others; it’s about recognizing when to lead, when to listen, and when to empower those around me. ABA’s value of success through collaboration perfectly aligns with my belief that the best results come from shared effort. I’m excited to bring this mindset to the team and contribute to a culture where we push each other to be our best.",Finance,Strategy,Business Development,https://drive.google.com/open?id=19zsXFgXhD_ef79pP3RLOL7vLYyElzWwE,"Website, Friend",Asian (including Indian subcontinent and Philippines origin),,28.0,29.0

ABA would not only give me an avenue to implement my skills to the world, but it would also help me develop my business intuition, contribute meaningfully to businesses, and become an active and helpful member of my community. Many companies, especially startups and small businesses, face complex strategic problems that they would likely need assistance dealing with. ABA would give me the opportunity to work on real-world cases, use math and data-driven skills I’ve gained throughout school, and create innovative solutions that make meaningful change. The club would expose me to business models and problem-solving frameworks while also giving me hands-on opportunities to translate my theoretical knowledge into practical insights that would make a tangible difference in my community. Additionally, I am interested in the supportive community that ABA offers. I’m not only eager to join a community who tackles and solves issues together, but I’m also looking to create strong bonds with like-minded people who share passions. Ultimately, I see ABA as a great opportunity to use my skills in math and economics to help my community, further develop business skills, and find a supportive and hard-working community that I could grow with.","The core value that I believe describes me the best is gain and give. I personally value experiences that encourage my growth while simultaneously helping out others in the process. In the past, I’ve been involved in many organizations that not only taught me problem-solving and teamwork skills, but also gave me opportunities to help my community, such as my high school’s ambassador program, key club, and peer tutoring. I valued these programs because while I was learning to work with others in a variety of tasks like managing events, setting up fundraisers, and teaching students, I was also contributing something to my community. For example, it feels fulfilling to use the knowledge I’ve gained in math and other STEM subjects to help other struggling students overcome challenging tasks and accomplish their goals. I believe ABA truly exemplifies this value by helping businesses achieve their goals through the members’ business and analytical skills.

In Semester Internships","Delhi. London. Toronto. New York. Birmingham.

Each city brought a new crowd, a new culture, and most importantly, new opportunities. Moving seemed fun until each change became a test of my versatility. I did not feel “Indian” enough in Delhi, definitely not “British” enough in London, and not adept enough to survive the hustle of New York. Throughout my life, I had to embrace adaptability to find welcoming communities. 

My desire to join ABA stems from the tight knit community that promotes growth beyond consulting. Having lacked it in the past, working alongside projects in a close family setting ignites genuine passion for development, something that I value coming to a brand new coast of America. 

I know that I can get closer to becoming a global changemaker through ABA. Working with all backgrounds of people as well as across the five project teams allows me to leave local bubbles, bringing about large scale business impacts that can lead societies to developmental equality. My home state, I quickly learned Alabama’s attitude towards economic production was far different from any other place I had lived, showing me that understanding innovation differences completes the puzzle to map out global change. I’m confident the collaboration and close-knit bonding ABA provides will help me illustrate my picture of universal transformation. 

At ABA, I hope to gain more than a team of good consultants, but rather, a strong group of friends that after the blend of professional and social work, turn into my close family.
","“What are we doing today?” 

As I walked into the Economics Club, lively discussions echoed around the room. I had a presentation ready to deliver, but quickly, I put it aside and let them continue. It was the first year of the club, but the way we talked, we could have been on Wall Street. 

Bright minds in a dim environment, I knew I just needed the platform. 

Watching the faces of my club members light up while trading, I found my calling in lifting my city. As such, I created Sophisticated Finance Society, designed to teach financial literacy around Birmingham. I was learning everything for the first time myself but I knew I had to give back. 

I shook a lot of hands, from economics professors to business leaders, but quite frankly, most of what they said went in one ear and out the other. However, one thing caught my attention: a bill for high school financial literacy.

Giving back after learning is key for bringing up underrepresented societies. Absent resources in Alabama, I knew I had to step up and give back to a community lacking strong mentorship. Truly, that success excited me the most; seeing smiles and passion across my city. 

Not long after, I sent out emails to Alabama’s state representatives asking how I could get involved. As I modified the curriculum, a smile spanned across my face. I changed my state forever.

The better question to ask, I thought— “What can we do today?”.

As someone passionate about financial literacy and advisory work, I want to strengthen my technical finance skills while applying them to real-world projects that create meaningful impact.

Through my experience as a VITA volunteer, I saw how financial knowledge directly affects individuals’ economic well-being. Many clients were unaware of tax credits or deductions they qualified for, reinforcing my belief that financial literacy is crucial. This is why I want to deepen my understanding of financial concepts beyond tax law—specifically in valuation, financial modeling, and advisory services. ABA’s Finance team provides the opportunity to apply these skills in a structured consulting setting while working with high-profile clients.

Beyond the technical side, I’m excited about learning from experienced peers in ABA’s Consultant Development Program and collaborating with a team that values precision, problem-solving, and analytical thinking. I want to contribute my own knowledge while continuously learning from those around me.

At the same time, I appreciate ABA’s #JSE (Just Serious Enough) value—work should be challenging, but it should also be fun. I’m looking for a team that is just as ambitious about finance as they are about making late-night work sessions enjoyable. Ultimately, I see ABA as a place where I can develop meaningful financial skills, tackle complex problems, and build lasting friendships along the way.
","I embody #GAIN&GIVE through my work as a Volunteer Income Tax Assistance (VITA) volunteer, a program that provides free tax help to low-income individuals. Many of my clients had never filed taxes before or didn’t realize they qualified for significant refunds, often leaving money unclaimed simply due to a lack of knowledge. Rather than just completing their returns, I made it a priority to teach them—breaking down tax laws into digestible explanations, guiding them through deductions like the Earned Income Tax Credit, and ensuring they understood how their tax situation applied to them beyond a single filing.

Beyond individual assistance, I took on a mentorship role by training new VITA volunteers. Many initially struggled to explain tax laws clearly, so I shared strategies—such as using analogies and step-by-step walkthroughs—to make complex financial concepts more approachable for clients. By helping new volunteers gain confidence, I ensured that financial literacy reached even more people.

This experience reinforced my belief that knowledge is most valuable when shared. Just as I benefited from mentorship when learning tax law, I made sure to give back by equipping others with the tools to navigate financial systems independently. At ABA, I want to continue this cycle—leveraging my skills to support others, learn from experienced mentors, and contribute to a community where growth and giving back go hand in hand.",Finance,Strategy,Business Development,https://drive.google.com/open?id=10uC55ZmEBREmZsz4U8o40Du6DiCfisXy,"Instagram, Friend",Asian (including Indian subcontinent and Philippines origin),,29.0,28.0

I don’t have too much prior experience in business or consulting, so I hope that through ABA, I will be able to enhance my business knowledge and learn more about and apply strategy. My main area of interest is the intersection of government and consulting, and I am interested in work revolving around NPOs which I am aware is a project team in ABA. 
In addition to all of the work that ABA has accomplished, I greatly appreciate and admire the organization’s mission. I think that business has a reputation for not always being the most honest field, but ABA’s promise to not give up “humility, integrity, and passion” has been an extremely respectable quality of the club that I feel I can look up to.

I think any organization can pride itself on certain personal characteristics or the importance of team building, but in my experience, an organization is nothing if the members do not have mutual love and respect for each other.
In past experiences, the work that was accomplished by a team that I was a part of was largely held together by the tight relationship that we had with each other. In high school, I was an editor of our school newspaper and was often put in stressful, time-sensitive environments with my fellow staff, but the one thing that helped us successfully run was the established relationship that we had. Because of this, not only were we able to openly communicate and get work done more efficiently, but the unwavering support that we were able to provide each other with was invaluable. I genuinely believe that without that, the organization would not have been able to function as effectively as it did.

Through my ten years of managing a salon business, I gained firsthand experience in areas such as financial management, negotiation, and team leadership. These experiences taught me the importance of adaptability and resilience in both business and law. At the same time, I have come to recognize how closely business acumen intersects with legal frameworks, especially in areas such as contracts, regulatory compliance, and economic policy. I hope to gain insights from my peers and mentors in ABA to strengthen my understanding of these connections.

By joining ABA, I also hope to contribute my unique perspective as someone with a dual focus on law and business.

I am hoping that through these friendships I will find mentors that will help guide me throughout my time in college. I have already received very useful guidance from Eric in just my first semester at college, and I feel that through ABA I will be able to receive even more incredible mentorship from the older members. The opportunity to consult for these massive companies is not something I plan to take for granted. These are special opportunities that I would otherwise not be able to take part in , and I am sure that this experience will help me find out which area of business I would like to pursue after I graduate.

I was one of the only freshmen on varsity, so I was always asking my older teammates for help. They gave me advice all throughout high school on what classes to take, advising me on which extracurriculars to get involved in, and they even gave me advice when it was time to apply for college. By the time I was a senior in high school, I started giving advice to my younger teammates. They would come up to me and ask me to help them choose their next semester classes, just like I used to do early in high school. I still try my best to give them advice even though I am in college.

Her words resonated deeply with me. Hilary arrived on campus as an undeclared major, unsure about her career path but eager to explore her options. I connected with her words because they describe how I feel as a first year Berkeley student. In fact, I was drawn to major in applied mathematics because of its versatility, leaving me open to a wide variety of career paths. Just like Hilary, I want to actively grow, learn, and explore my options, and I believe ABA is the perfect place to do this. 

After speaking with project leads like Minju and Gina, I saw how ABA’s projects provide hands-on experience in key business areas–data collection, analysis, decking, and more. These opportunities align with my curiosity and will help me develop valuable skills while gaining insight into various industries. 

Beyond professional growth, what stood out most was ABA’s tight-knit, supportive community. From the lighthearted banter between project teams to the jokes made among members during the networking session, #ABALOVE was evident. I look forward to the opportunity to contribute to and learn from such an incredible community. It is clear that ABA is not just an organization but a family, and one I would love to join.

I’m excited to collaborate with a driven team, build meaningful connections, and broaden my professional horizons through ABA!
","I have always embraced mentorship, using what I’ve learned to help others succeed.  Math was one of my strongest subjects, but I realized many struggled with it. This led me to work at Mathnasium, a math tutoring center, where I tutored K-12 students. Watching my students succeed showed me how effective it can be for me to share the skills I have learned with others. This experience also reinforced the importance of not just giving answers but guiding them to understand concepts themselves. 

I carry this principle of mentorship into every aspect of my life. At home I am the resident tech support, helping my mom navigate her new online business. From MacBook tips and tricks to spreadsheet formatting, I always take the time to teach my skills to her. I also mentor my younger brother in computer science, a subject that he is currently struggling in. I frequently call him (or sit down with him when I’m home) and break down complex Python functions and database interactions in ways he can understand, ensuring that he will be able to implement what I teach independently. He recently told me I taught him more in 30 minutes than his teacher did in the entire semester.

To have a community to support and believe in me would be invaluable to me, due to how elusive it has been in my life.  Because of my ADHD, I have often been made to feel incapable of or ill-suited to pursue my ambitions.  In ABA, I would finally be a part of a supportive network that assesses me on my merits and potential, not assumptions.
     By being a member of ABA, I hope to get closer to achieving my future goals of working in business and development within the entertainment industry with my Economics major.  Consulting would allow me to develop the research, analysis, and strategy development skills I need to achieve my career goals. Business experience is a necessary counterpart to the knowledge I gain in my Economics courses, which will enable me to use an understanding of market behavior in a highly dynamic and innovative field.  After my internship with the Los Angeles Media Fund, which taught me how to formulate strategies for the company's growth and contribute to executive decisions, I am prepared to take on challenging cases in ABA and excited to offer my perspectives to diverse clothes.  Aside from being a member of a supportive community, I hope my time working with ABA paves the way for my future success in the professional entertainment world.
","     ABA’s core values of learning and giving back best describes me, as I deeply value the benefits and experience of contributing to a community.  When I was in middle school, I was diagnosed with ADHD. At LACES (which is my current high school, but also includes a middle school) this triggered automatic enrollment in a “special reading” class, in place of an art elective. And I wasn’t the only one: none of the neurodivergent students at my school got the chance to see what they could achieve in a creative setting.
     As I got older, and watched students like myself get denied the chance to discover and pursue their passions by enrolling in electives of their choice, I decided to create an outreach program where I could share my passion, the art of storytelling, with those who couldn’t otherwise access it.  
     I developed the Screenwriters’ Guild of LACES to create a community where neurodiverse students could express themselves and make up for the lost opportunities to share their diverse creative talents. Members of the neurodivergent community are often stigmatized as “flawed” or “unable.” The Screenwriters’ Guild of LACES has not only become a safe space where people can share ideas but also a beacon of solidarity. As I move into more challenging environments, I am very aware of the demand for strong communities offering support, opportunities for expression, and representation in the arts for people of all abilities, and hopefully, this unique perspective can assist me in working with ABA.

	Adil and Sharan have always spoken highly of ABA, and reading through each ABA member’s favorite memory on the website, I’m confident each member has a blast in the club. Everyone has mentioned this past Fall semester’s retreat and how fun the activites like tubing were, and even writing this application makes me feel excited that there’s even a chance I could possibly earn some of those life-long memories as well.
	Finally, ABA’s 5 services intrigues me. Talking to members of BD, Strategy, and Marketing, the overlap between the three made me prioritize these services. I admire how ABA members switch niches after a few semesters to different services, and that makes the club so unique. Any of these three services would fulfill my inner desire to have my changes heard for an actual business.
","	#JSE has remained the core value that best describes me, even one semester later. ‘Just Serious Enough’ is practically my spirit animal of a core value, as I’ve tried to apply this value in my life in a multitude of ways.
	The first way I’ve applied this value in my life was in the activities I engage in, here at Berkeley. As a member of a Bollywood Fusion Dance Team here, UCB Zahanat, we perform our 10-minute dance set at different competitions. Watching our set come together from literally nothing to a full performance with costumes, productions, challenging choreography, and more reminds me that spending your time doing your hobbies, here at Berkeley, has been one of my priorities. Even outside of dance, #JSE has contributed to my life in other ways, such as when I lose $20 in poker after calling a shove because ""it's just poker.” Even when I’m at Crossroads or Second Street thrifting nice vintage pieces, I’ll drop $30, even when I’m not too fond of an item just because of #JSE. 
	#JSE hasn’t just hurt my wallet though, as I know in professional settings like in ABA, it will be used in moderation. Completing our required project tasks is obviously the priority, but I know our project team will have fun doing it, with many ""let's lock in"" interruptions along the way.

Involved in the ASUC Legal Office, interviewing for a research positions, volunteering at Oakland Unified School District to teach music","I’m interested in ABA because it offers a mix of technical, transferable skill-building and a community of people who are genuinely passionate about their work. I am studying Neuroscience, Economics, and Music, and I really appreciate how ABA brings together diverse perspectives from a variety of majors under five different projects that all cultivate different skills, whether for nonprofit work or fields like finance and marketing. I’m especially excited about the NPO project category, and exploring how business and social good intersect while navigating policy and demography.
What really stood out to me about ABA is how “down-to-earth” everyone is, a common saying I have not only heard about from members but noticed firsthand both at tabling and in a coffee chat. Before I interacted with ABA, I hadn’t really thought about joining a consulting club, but the group’s approachable, collaborative vibe made me feel like it’s a place where I can both contribute and learn. 
From the team experience, I’m hoping to push myself outside my comfort zone and get exposure and experience with problem-solving and the critical thinking skills needed to work effectively not only in business, but in other real world industries. I’m excited to learn how strategies can drive change and create impact. Ultimately, I hope ABA helps me sharpen my business skills and find a community of like-minded people at Berkeley that I will be connected to for a lifetime. ","The ABA core value that resonates most with me is Gain & Give. I believe that mentorship is one of the most effective ways to learn, and the best way to honor that knowledge is by passing it on to others; a big reason for why ABA spoke to me was the mentorship within the club. Giving back has been a consistent thread throughout my life, and it was my goal in college to continue this. 
I’ve been playing the viola since fifth grade and have been lucky enough to learn from awesome teachers who helped me earn a scholarship in UC Berkeley’s Music department. Viola is an underrepresented instrument, and I realized that many inner-city programs are without violists, and universities actively look for viola players, so I created an outreach program to help students explore this path and take advantage of scholarship opportunities.
Last summer, I ran a viola camp for beginning players in the St. Louis Public School District, with the aim of not only improving their technical skill but helping them to find a genuine connection with music. I wasn’t sure how I’d feel about teaching, but quickly found that teaching not only helped the students but also deepened my own appreciation for the instrument.
At Berkeley, I continue teaching similarly by volunteering with the Oakland Unified School District and local retirement homes. I teach music to students who might not otherwise have the chance, helping them build confidence that goes beyond just music, which has been the most enriching part of my time at Berkeley so far.

Businesses succeed when products address human needs.  Deals are made, and plans are implemented when communication is clear and open.  ABA appeals to me because it focuses on the human connection as much as it values professional development.  Not only do ABA’s info sessions emit professionalism, but throughout, I see the emphasis on community as evidenced by the happy camaraderie in the images chosen to represent ABA on its website and in the warmth experienced at the events.  Further, its mission statement and core values explicitly emphasize the importance of people and community.  ABA’s successful investment into people and relationships is clearly seen in its prestigious clientele with their personal words of praise.  

The diversity of industries represented by the clientele also appeals, as does ABA’s project teams. I have experience in tech, healthcare, retail, and municipal government, and look forward to exploring all sectors and aspects of business as all are related.

Coming from a design-thinking charter school, I deeply resonate with ABA’s mission and values.  I have been trained to tackle issues humanly and holistically, devising practical, efficient solutions from a multicultural perspective. Applying design-thinking, I completed a two-year Innovation Diploma, where I led a team to research solutions for eliminating cultural barriers in Japan. I continued to broaden my perspective by joining GMP and spending a semester in London to learn other ways of life.  With every interaction with diverse persons, I hope to gain the understanding and relationships that underlie successful ventures, all while developing my professional acumen at Haas and under ABA’s tutelage.","While all five of ABA’s core values truly resonate with me, #GAIN&GIVE and #JSE stood out the most.

Throughout my life, I have been fortunate enough to be supported by family, friends, and classmates.  They shaped me into the person I am today, my work ethic, interests, and even my sense of humor. My experiences in a military family, team sports, and volunteerism all emphasized learning and giving back. My gratitude taught me to pay it forward, giving help whenever possible. 

My friendship with an upperclassman in high school has been particularly defining in my life. Her guidance on college applications, resumes, and relationships has been a flashlight clearing my foggy future. Though we met through our high school robotics team, our friendship and her influence is long-lasting. With her as a model, I, in turn, have guided an underclassman through his life decisions. I find satisfaction in sharing my experiences, resolving his issues, whether they involve his workload or relationships. At times, all that’s needed is some one-on-one soccer practice, giving companionship and support.

Yet, what is life if we can’t have fun? I embrace the motto of being “just serious enough” to gain the practical skills and expertise to be a productive and respected problem-solver while always being open enough to laugh at myself and to bring fun to others as I did on my soccer teams and when running events like Senior Assassin.  A daily does of laughter solves a lot.  Embracing ABA’s spirit of mentorship, I hope to be supportive by being a dependable and reassuring teammate.

I ended up talking to a few of them afterward, and later, at Women in Business Night and the ABA info sessions, I got to meet even more people—from consultants to VPs to the president. Each time, I walked away even more excited about the club. I loved the structure, the energy, and the values ABA stood for—it felt like a place where people weren’t just focused on professional success, but also on learning, growing, and supporting each other along the way.
What really stuck with me was how genuinely open and welcoming everyone was. People were willing to offer everything from life advice to application tips—or just to be a friend. There was no sense of hierarchy or exclusivity; instead, it felt like a thriving, collaborative community where everyone wanted to see each other succeed. And on top of that, the projects lined up this semester—working with companies like Google, Chase, and Microsoft—completely blew me away. The fact that ABA members take on real-world business challenges at such a high level, while still being students, is something I find so inspiring, and I’d love the chance to be part of that.
For me, ABA isn’t just about gaining experience—it’s about growing alongside people who push you to be better while still making the journey fun. I know that in ABA, I’ll find the mentorship, challenges, and friendships that will help me grow both professionally and personally, and I would be privileged to be a part of it.
","
The ABA core value that best describes me is #GAIN&GIVE—Learn and Give Back. One of the most meaningful things I’ve done is 'Aurat Aur Haqook,' a platform I founded to amplify the voices of underrepresented women in Pakistan.
Growing up, I didn’t just hear about oppression—I saw it firsthand. I’ve seen girls forced into marriage, women trapped in abusive households, and young daughters pulled out of school for child labor. What’s most heartbreaking is that this isn’t just a rare tragedy—it’s an everyday reality for so many. I started Aurat Aur Haqook as a small social media initiative, just hoping to start conversations. But as I listened to more and more women’s stories, I realized that awareness alone wasn’t enough. They needed real resources, legal aid, and actual solutions.
Since then, it’s grown into a community-driven movement, connecting women with nonprofit legal NGOs, crisis support networks, and authorities who can step in and help. But even now, I know it’s just the beginning. There’s so much more I want to do, and the biggest challenge is figuring out how to scale that impact. That’s why ABA’s mission speaks to me—the idea that we learn, grow, and then pass that knowledge forward is exactly what I’ve been trying to do with my own work. At ABA, I know I’ll not only gain new skills but also have the chance to use them in real projects, alongside people who share that same drive to make an impact. That’s the kind of community I want to be part of.

Possibly URAP? ","I believe ABA’s strong emphasis on fostering collaboration as well as its diverse projects offers an opportunity for exploration in different professional interests while giving its members the chance to learn from a range of perspectives and expertise. After conversing with many of the members and hearing about my friend’s personal experiences in the club, I truly resonated with the community and everyone had highlighted some of their fondest memories back to the club. Not only were the projects spread across a diverse range of interests, but the club also allowed hands-on experience for its new members and flexible access to explore the other teams. Additionally, ABA’s driven and supportive community allows for close mentorship and connections with alumni. Through my own personal team experiences, I hope to join a close-knit community that motivates me to set higher goals and values collaborative success. Additionally, I aim to develop life-long skills that will not only advance my career but also foster a continual eagerness for learning, enabling me to give back to future members.","Out of ABA’s five core values, I believe #INIT2GETHER resonates with me the most. Collaboration is key to effective leadership, and my experiences have shown me how important it is to listen to and value others’ perspectives, even when they differ from my own. When I started my tutoring business in high school, I had to create my own curriculum to train other student tutors and build a team to work with kids on reading development. By regularly gathering feedback from my team and holding monthly meetings, I gained valuable insights that helped improve the business. Similarly, in projects like my skin cancer awareness workshops, I learned to incorporate feedback from guest speakers to enhance the workshops. What contributed most to my success was genuinely appreciating the input and ideas of my peers and teammates. While I gained experience in organizing and leading, I also came to deeply value collaboration and the support teammates give each other to reach their goals.",Strategy,Business Development,Marketing,https://drive.google.com/open?id=1XHAdRxsyNNkUXEC_6rY7qNXjQhVRE_8Z,Friend,Asian (including Indian subcontinent and Philippines origin),,28.0,28.0

As many ABA members have noted, training can be as simple as watching a YouTube video, but mastering skills like face-to-face presentations with clients, on-the-fly adjustments, and maintaining composure under pressure requires more than just a YouTube video. I find comfort in the fact that the people teaching me these lessons would be people as invested in my personal growth as I am. ABA has made me feel, beyond any other club or community group, that they desire to learn from me as much as I do from them. There is a certain solace in knowing that ABA would be there to push me beyond the limits of my comfort while also being there to pick me up when I fail. It is for this reason that I'm not afraid to try with ABA, because I know that they would accept my failures as much as my successes and be there, high or low. I hope ABA can teach me to be more comfortable with failure so I can reach for more successes, and I hope that ABA will challenge me, just like they have all week, to go beyond the limits of my own comfort and reach for things that I believe to be unachievable.","My experience at the George Marks Children's Hospital, which has been one of the most impactful experiences of my life, best exemplifies the idea of #Gain&Give. GMCH forced me to learn in ways that I never thought I would have to, whether it be learning how to make split-second decisions when a patient experiences a seizure or to deal with absence after a patient is gone. Or perhaps my hardest lesson—learning how to be okay with patients expressing discomfort and coming to terms with the fact that there will be times I simply can't make it better. My worst memory, of pushing a 21-year-old man up and down a hill in a manual wheelchair while he screamed and cried for 2 hours, became a lesson I constantly remind myself of: to give myself grace, because despite what people say, your best effort isn't always going to be enough, and that's okay. Working in hospice care, there is always a keen awareness of the inevitable. But choosing to devote your time and energy into someone knowing it'll only make it harder when they're gone—that is the truest way to give. Many of us get so caught up in greed and competition that we can hardly see what matters, but in truly giving, you'll gain more than anything you could win out of self-centered motivation or competition. In those moments of compassion and connection, I discovered the profound impact I could have on another's journey, even if it's just in fleeting moments.",NPO,Finance,Marketing,https://drive.google.com/open?id=1ace8e0nzSbIW3OSEN0tU26GMDuV06HId,Calapalooza,"Asian (including Indian subcontinent and Philippines origin), Middle Eastern",I only uploaded my home high school transcript but I took classes at 2 others and 1 other college as well that I can email if necessary.,28.0,28.0

I think ABA could definitely be the Cal community I’ve been searching for. As an engineering major with limited experience in business or consulting, I’m looking forward to learning more about an area I’ve always been interested in from mentors and upperclassmen who are eager to teach and have been in my shoes before. I think working on big projects with international clients like Microsoft or Chase is truly an invaluable experience. Personally, I would love to be a part of the marketing, strategy, or business development teams, and I hope to explore the consulting field while getting to know my project team. I’m also excited to see how my experiences in ABA tie into my engineering career!

","Gain&Give resonates with me the most, and I believe it is necessary to share your experiences and knowledge with the people around you. I’ve gained several skills over the past years, and using them to help others within my community has always been the best part. For example, I’ve been playing cello since I was in the 3rd grade. As I became a better musician, I started to perform outside of my lessons, practices, and competitions: visiting senior centers with my church’s youth orchestra, volunteering to teach students at a local elementary school, even playing at events like weddings and parties. These opportunities to give back arose when I lacked musical motivation, and seeing how my talents could be used in multiple ways encouraged me to continue learning cello. I’ve also had experience coding both Java and Python, skills that I thought would only be useful in a future internship or job. However, alongside a non-profit organization centered around computer science education, I taught programming to Korean foster students, as well as high schoolers in Tanzania.

It was designed to give back to both its clients and members. I resonate with its strong foundation in handling diverse cases, providing professional guidance, and fostering problem-solving skills.

Through various roles, I have worked on marketing and business strategies. In my most recent project at Splice, I served as a business strategy consultant for their cloud-based music creation platform. I identified and curated a list of music ambassadors who aligned with the brand’s objectives by using and promoting the platform. Through this experience, I developed skills in conducting effective market research and leveraging data to refine resource allocation within a specific demographic for Splice.

At ABA, I hope to apply what I have learned through various projects while building relationships within its tight-knit community. I value the balance between social and professional development and strive to enhance my practical and critical-thinking skills in the consulting field. The strong network of mentors, alumni, and clients within ABA is essential to my continued growth. Through this team experience, I look forward to learning from my peers and collaborating to develop impactful strategies for ABA clients.

Over the past four years, I’ve learned this firsthand, working at the intersection of education and awareness. As Co-Chair of the Rotary Vietnam Project, our goal was to spread one message. The atrocities of human trafficking and the power of education in preventing it. Collaborating with Rotaries globally, we secured grants, and through my speeches and the fundraisers, our efforts peaked in raising over $300,000! Eventually, I became Co-Chair for RVP, running our team of over 20 and 6000 volunteers across the globe to address systemic disparities these children feel continuously.

While my background is rooted in nonprofit leadership, true innovation requires a synthesis of business and social consciousness. ABA offers an environment where I can bridge these two worlds—learning to dissect complex problems, develop data-driven solutions, and deliver actionable insights to mission-driven organizations. The prospect of working directly with clients, designing sustainable strategies, and observing direct impact within the business field is exciting.

Beyond work, I’m drawn to the camaraderie of ABA. There’s something uniquely compelling about working alongside peers who are equally passionate about social impact yet bring diverse perspectives. I want to immerse myself in this culture of exchanging ideas and building an unbreakable community while contributing my storytelling and global nonprofit experience. I see ABA not just as a stepping stone, but as a transformative space where business meets purpose, and where I can evolve into the kind of leader who doesn’t just dream of impact—but delivers it.","SUCCESS THROUGH COLLABORATION

When I first began high school, I embarked on my journey into the United States Academic Decathlon (USAD), a competition club based around ten different tests. As a freshman, I often felt lost, overwhelmed, and unsupported by my team. With time, I knew from experience that simply providing resources wasn’t enough to fully comprehend the broad scope of knowledge we needed to learn, so I opted to step in as a guide for the team.

I became the unofficial study manager, developing engaging curricula on taxonomy, chemistry, math, and many other subjects while also fostering our team collaboration through the countless puzzles I created. Our shared fear dissolved into collective laughter as we moved past a purely competitive atmosphere, uncovering the wonders that collaboratively studying for tests could bring to our family. Steadily, our culture shifted. Rather than competing against each other, I created a group that solved problems as a team, building upon each others’ weaknesses and subsequently filling in our understanding. Being a leader wasn’t merely based on delegating tasks, and critiquing errors but rather on inspiring and encouraging others to reach their fullest potential, and I intend to bring this energy to ABA as well!

Whether through the coffee chats I've had with members like David or the people I met at the networking sessions, it's really clear that everyone in ABA is genuinely super nice, chill, and enjoys each other's company. As a sophomore, I want to find a community of people who are supportive of each other and find a group of people I can eventually call family - and at ABA, I definitely envision that happening. The consistent socials, kickbacks, and retreats that ABA holds are another sign that the club values this community aspect and isn't afraid to share help and resources with one another. While I'm not set on a career in consulting, I do want to do something in finance/strategy down the line, and I know that the people in ABA will support me through and through.

Beyond the people, the project work and environment at ABA is super unique. Being able to work with experienced members of the team who have such diverse professional experiences, including PM/SWE/Consulting/etc., is another way I can expand my skillset and learn how to think critically while on these projects. The consulting framework is an interesting way to think through problems, and I think ABA's diversity in career and professional interests would only enhance my ability to think through problems and find effective ways to solve them.","#INIT2GETHER perfectly describes who I am. Above all else, I consider myself a dedicated team player – a mentality that took root during my middle school years. As an ice hockey player, our coach consistently emphasized that 'the whole is greater than the sum of its parts.' This principle resonates deeply, not just in hockey, but in all aspects of life. Whether I'm working on projects in class or participating in club activities, I make it my mission to foster engagement among all team members, motivating those around me to collaborate effectively. I believe in creating an environment where teamwork drives success and everyone has the chance to contribute their best work. 

True leadership, I've come to realize, transcends formal titles or positions. It's about creating impact and guiding others regardless of your official role – a philosophy that has shaped my approach to club involvement. In my club (CBA),  Though I'm a sophomore without a formal leadership title, I've proactively carved out opportunities to contribute meaningfully: leading educational workshops, sharing in-depth financial knowledge with fellow members, and becoming an academic mentor.

","“Be humble, be ambitious, and be tenacious” encapsulates where my goals in college and how I want to extend my involvement from my high school experience. 

To me, this tricolon means speaking up and considering perspectives that otherwise would be silenced: As part of my high school newspaper, I took on an investigative journalism project where I attempted to uncover instances of cheating on standardized exams at my school. Against a backdrop of political censorship in my school’s host country, I realized I was in a position to change the noncommunicative, taboo-dominated status quo in my campus community. In a podcast series released on our website, my team and I detailed the scandal’s timeline, complete with interviews with school administrators.

Since the podcast’s inception, members of the newspaper and I have been encouraged by its positive reception to continue discussing the sensitive issues that matter most to our audience. To me, our act of defiance against a culture of taboo embodies what it means to be ambitious, tenacious, yet humble. 

From soccer teams to club leadership teams and group project teams, I can elevate any team. As a goalkeeper, I direct my defense to anticipate weaknesses in our back line. In my student government committee, I worked extra hours alongside four other brilliant officers to instate club participation quotas and an election oversight mechanism. My past experiences completely align with this value and I am so glad to have found an organization like ABA with such highly-aligned aims.

These principles resonate deeply with me, and I am excited by the opportunity to engage in complex problem solving and working in collaboration with like minded individuals who also embrace these traits. One of the things that draws me to ABA is the chance to engage in hands-on consulting projects. I am particularly interested in gaining practical experience in areas like marketing and finance, and I believe that ABA is the perfect place to hone these skills while working alongside others. I truly look forward to the opportunity to learn from a diverse group, each with their own unique perspectives and experiences. Additionally, I was intrigued by the mentorship opportunities through ABA’s Consultant Development Program. Learning from experienced mentors will allow me to gain exposure to different business sectors that will be key in developing my leadership abilities. ABA’s emphasis on collaboration, growth, and supporting its members’ success is the kind of environment I would like to be part of to help shape me into a good business leader. ","Among all ABA’s core values, collaboration best resonates with me. I firmly believe that growth and learning occur when different perspectives come together, allowing us to tackle complex problems more effectively. In my experience, solving difficult challenges alone is far less effective than a diverse set of minds bringing in unique ideas and insights. I did not fully grasp this concept until recently when I was tasked with a graphic design project where I had to design a logo for a small business. Initially, I believed that I was capable of handling everything myself, but after I received critical feedback, I saw how much my design improved implementing the suggestions. I learned that collaborating and seeking help doesn’t diminish one’s abilities, but rather amplifies creativity and broadens understanding. Beyond design, I have seen how effective collaborations can be in business. Working at my family’s restaurant, adaptability and the willingness to listen is crucial for a successful business. Through these experiences, I’ve come to understand that solving problems as a team is not only more efficient, but it also fosters innovation and creativity.

I believe, the bifurcation of departments allows one to dive deeply into their areas of interest, which I find incredibly valuable given the broad scope of consulting. 

Moreover, ABA’s commitment to collaborating with larger companies is especially appealing. The chance to engage in high-impact projects with established organizations and to gain insight into their operations is an experience I deeply look forward to. During coffee chats, I was reassured of the tangible value and professional exposure ABA offers, which only strengthened my interest in the club.

As someone still exploring my professional path, I see ABA’s team-oriented environment as an ideal setting to learn and grow. While I am passionate about engineering, I find myself increasingly drawn to fields like business and consulting. Through ABA, I hope to connect with individuals from diverse backgrounds, broaden my perspective, and refine my professional interests. Ultimately, I aspire to contribute meaningfully to my team while discovering where my unique strengths align with my future goals.","I resonate with the core value of #BE because it reflects the mindset I’ve developed growing up across continents. I never had one home, always travelled and spent the last six years at an all boys boarding school. These are a set of diverse experiences that have definitely taught me the importance of humility, collaboration, and resilience in the face of challenges, while also fueling my ambition to explore new horizons.

Living in a boarding school exposed me to people from vastly different cultures and backgrounds, teaching me that everyone has something valuable to contribute. I learned the importance of listening, understanding others’ perspectives, and approaching every interaction with humility. This “we over I” philosophy became second nature to me, and as such I believe in the idea of always thinking big and putting your best foot forward to achieve it. 

At the same time, these experiences have also pushed me to think ambitiously about my goals. Moving between global environments and adapting to new circumstances taught me to constantly ask, “What’s next?” Whether it was navigating academic challenges, pursuing my interests in aerospace engineering, or looking to venture into the field of consulting, I’ve embraced opportunities to grow with tenacity and high standards.

For me, #BE is a strong statement of intent, and I feel for a driven person like me, it strongly resonates with my core values.

I have been looking more into the business development and non profit organization side of it. I am interested in the different projects ABA goes on to do and how they execute these projects every semester. I hope to gain a deeper understanding and knowledge on tackling cases. I am interested in seeing how ABA executes cases that clients approach them with.  Learning all the different strategies there are for a consulting case would help me in the future and it definitely seems like an experience that I should gain knowledge about. I see myself in the future going into consulting, so joining a consulting club like ABA would be the best preparation for that. Beyond professional growth, I would also like to gain the friendships and closeness this club has created. Building these close friendships with similar individuals will not only make my experience enjoyable, but also help create a strong and supported environment around me. Overall, being in this club can help me grow both professionally and personally which is something I am very interested in doing over the next couple years.
","Gain and Give to me is learning valuable tools and later teaching it to others to have a sense of that knowledge in the future. Gain and Give really speaks to me because of my past experiences in high school.  I had the chance to visit several elementary schools and teach science experiments to the kids. This was an experience I found both rewarding and impactful. Seeing the kid’s excitement and curiosity made me realize how much I enjoy sharing my knowledge and motivating others to do the same. This was my way of giving back to the community because I remember when I was younger, I would have high school students teach me different science experiments. Being in that position always made me so happy because I had people who cared enough to teach me. Being able to give back was one of my favorite things because I got to share what I learned over the years. This core value really resonates with me because I hope to share my knowledge with future new members in ABA.

","I am drawn to ABA because of its commitment to investing not just in its projects, but also in its members and its community—a quality that sets it apart from other organizations. ABA fosters an environment where individuals come together to share knowledge, support one another, and grow collectively. This spirit of collaboration and mutual investment deeply resonates with me, as I thrive in environments where people are driven, innovative, and focused on achieving success as a united team.
I am particularly interested in joining the marketing group within ABA. My past work experiences in creative content development and media strategy have highlighted the importance of being part of a community where individuals can listen to each other, engage in constructive disagreements, and still align toward shared goals. I have learned that effective collaboration fuels innovation and drives impactful results—qualities I believe ABA exemplifies.
What excites me most about joining ABA is the opportunity to be surrounded by like-minded individuals who are ambitious and tenacious in their respective fields. I want to contribute my creative perspective and collaborative mindset to foster an environment where everyone’s ideas are heard and valued. By exchanging insights and learning from my peers, I aim to enhance my problem-solving abilities and develop a well-rounded approach to tackling challenges.
Through ABA, I hope to gain opportunities founded on innovation and engagement. I am eager to participate in dynamic projects that push boundaries and encourage creative thinking. Beyond skill development, I seek a team experience that builds strong, lasting relationships with peers who inspire me to strive for excellence.","The ABA core value #BE—Be Humble, Be Ambitious, Be Tenacious—perfectly embodies my approach to life and leadership. Growing up, my mother always emphasized that humility is the cornerstone of success. She instilled in me the belief that true strength of character means being the hardest worker in the room while remaining grounded and true to oneself. This philosophy has guided my actions throughout my academic and extracurricular pursuits.
One example that demonstrates this value is my tenure as secretary of the National Honor Society (NHS) during high school. Securing this leadership role required a rigorous application and interview process. However, rather than focusing solely on my own achievements or status, I viewed my role as an opportunity to foster a collaborative and supportive environment within the organization.
To this end, I initiated the “Double X” program, designed to connect NHS members with students interested in receiving guidance, mentorship, or simply a space to share their passions. This initiative encouraged the development of new interests and allowed members to share their knowledge in meaningful ways. By leveraging the diverse skills and experiences of the NHS membership, we created a network where everyone felt empowered to learn and teach.
Through this experience, I demonstrated tenacity in implementing a new program, ambition in envisioning its impact, and humility by emphasizing the collective success of the group rather than my own role.

As a premed student with a dream of becoming a dermatologist, I never considered business or consulting as areas relevant to my pathway. I only recently made the connection that dermatology and consulting are similar in a sense, as both require identifying a problem, solving it, and effectively communicating solutions to clients/patients. This sparked my curiosity about consulting, and I believe ABA is the perfect opportunity to explore it in a team-oriented environment. However, what excites me most about ABA is the chance to build meaningful relationships with my peers in the club. While I do look forward to developing business and consulting knowledge, my true motivation comes from the aspect of tackling challenges alongside a team. I think this is the best way to build long lasting friendships. 

Overall, my enthusiasm for ABA is less about adding another achievement to my resume and more about the people that I’ll be surrounded by. I hope to work on meaningful projects not just for professional growth, but because I genuinely enjoy working together and having fun along throughout the process. But don’t get me wrong – I can assure you that I will put in full effort into any project that I am assigned to. More than anything, I look forward to forming lifelong friendships and creating everlasting memories, and find a community that will indulge in my hobbies with me as much as I would love to indulge in yours!","I think ABA's #BE would best describe the Justin Do of today. Through many experiences, I adapted the belief that “we” is so much more powerful than “I”. 

The first time I realized the importance of these traits was during my freshman year of highschool, where I served as a team captain for a multi-organizational tree planting event. I was tasked to lead 20 volunteers to replace a set amount of invasive plant species with new trees, within the allotted time frame. After a tree planting demonstration, I noticed the energy of my team shifted as the volunteers dispersed to their own little silos. Something didn’t feel right. I wanted to make this event more fun for everyone, so I tried initiating conversations and was eventually able to get our team to enjoy working through this hardship in the blazing heat together. Through dynamic collaboration, I noticed that each person had their own strengths and weaknesses. Some of our members were better at digging with a shovel and others were great at applying techniques to neatly planting the trees. By working with each other’s strengths and offsetting each other’s weaknesses, we were not only able to go beyond our quota for the day but also made some great relationships along the way.

As someone who wants to pursue business in a future career path, I believe that a consulting club is the next best step in advancing towards a valued job because of the experience and networking. Whether through business development, marketing, or strategy, Berkeley ABA provides the opportunity to grow in a field that I want to pursue. Of all the many different consulting clubs where I have attended info sessions and coffee chatted with dozens of people, ABA has been unique in that the community is less of an organization and more of a family. From attending events and meeting members, it is evident that “ABA Love” is truly a core value in the club and not just a gimmic. Coming to Berkeley, I wanted to find a group of people that shared similar values whether in academics or in leisure. The members that I have got the chance to meet have shown me ABA is the community I want to be apart of and grow with. In team experience, I want to solidify my skills in business development and be reassured that it is the path I want to pursue for my next walk in life. Lastly, I want the chance to work with other people and learn from the mentors and even fellow new members. ","ABA Love is the main core value that best describes me. As a child and even until a teenager, my parents' divorce filled me with anger and I pushed it on to others which led to a great loss of friends. However, this gave me time to rethink my persona and understand why I acted the way I did. Throughout high school and even until now, I was able to fix my mindset and realize ""life is hard enough"" so I may as well love people.

ABA promises real-world experience many steps above the quality available to me before Berkeley. However, the community culture has proven to be just as valuable.

Coming to a new university, some people have shown respect for the low UC-to-UC transfer rate, but they rarely see the resolve needed to accept that offer. ABA's members have made me feel truly seen, demonstrating sympathy, understanding, and admiration for my path. They understand that leaving the path I paved for myself and my community at UCSB--in research, in consulting, and with friends--to carve a new one at Berkeley was risky, daunting, and sometimes lonely. I want to extend my genuine appreciation for everyone's thoughtfulness, and I see that ABA is a community of people who truly see beyond the surface level.

I'd like to curate my background experiences in a contrasting environment and university culture to the social and professional dynamics at ABA, hoping to learn from everyone and share when I can. With experience in campus marketing, software, start-ups, sustainability, and financial technology, I'd like to continue my strategy consulting, learning from people from various backgrounds and project managers with strengths different from mine. ","While the core values work in tandem to build ABA’s unique culture, #INIT2GETHER resonates deeply with me. In honesty, “success through collaboration” is a motto I didn’t expect to see at Berkeley. 

I believe that genuine intentions are the founding basis of passion, ambition, and perseverance. Without these three--and the preceding factor--goals will remain goals. Having a community that not only wishes the best for one another but also encourages through constructive criticism and teachings is the key to streamlining project processes, and is the cornerstone of high-quality results. 

As a Project Manager at Gaucho Creative, directing my team through respect, mutual admiration, and consistent communication was critical to the flow of our 10-week projects. Though I managed the team with an Account Manager, ultimately, the cultivation of our project was a comprehensive synergy of every member’s strengths and interests, bouncing ideas between one another, encouraging, supporting, and giving credit as needed. While the project’s liabilities largely lay on me and my account manager, our team always took responsibility with us, and that is where I learned the essence of collaboration as a genuine form of care and integrity.

I may have been expecting Berkeley to be a place of hostility, hearing that competition existed even between peers. Yet, ABA’s community has demonstrated a deep reflection of how I value and carry genuine intentions through not only social interactions, but also into the professional space.

Specifically, I aim to strengthen my analytical thinking, problem-solving, and presentation skills while working on real-world projects with a team of driven students.  

I plan to contribute to ABA by bringing my academic background in business administration and finance, along with the analytical skills I have developed through coursework and past experiences.

Success is never achieved alone, and this mindset has been central to our experiences.  

During the CESIM business simulation competition, our team ranked first in both the European Qualifiers and Global Finals among over 9,000 participants from 500+ universities. This achievement was only possible through strong collaboration, where each member brought unique insights to manage a virtual corporation. Together, we tackled complex financial models, analyzed market trends, and built strategic decisions that propelled us forward. Every challenge we faced was an opportunity to learn from one another, reinforcing the idea that teamwork and shared ambition drive success.  

Following this, we had the opportunity to guide 50 graduate students in one of France’s top Master in Management programs. Teaching wasn’t just about sharing knowledge, it was about fostering an environment where everyone could grow. By working closely with others, we strengthened our ability to convey strategic insights while learning from different perspectives. Humility kept us open to new ideas, ambition pushed us to aim higher, and tenacity ensured we never settled for less than our best.

I identified key patterns in admissions data and translated them into actionable insights for students navigating the application process. These experiences have strengthened my technical and analytical skills, but I want to develop a more strategic, business-oriented mindset. ABA provides the perfect opportunity to bridge this gap by applying my technical background to real-world consulting challenges.

I know that doctor’s notes are simply a filtered retelling of what a patient said and felt during the appointment and may not always reflect their story. So I created an online platform for students, parents, and overlooked storytellers to narrate for themselves. On Outwrite, users write and share their anecdotes to an inclusive community.

Seeing how deeply members value both professional development and personal connection made me realize that ABA is exactly the kind of environment I want to be a part of.

","Among ABA’s core values, “Gain and Give” embodies the essence of my journey. Growing up, my grandparents were my biggest sources of love and support. My grandma cared for me when my parents couldn’t whether it be picking me up from school, making dinner, helping me shower, and even sneaking me Hot Cheetos to cheer me up. My grandpa always believed in me and had my back when things got tough at home. Losing him to stage 4 lung cancer in 2021 was devastating, especially when I realized I hadn’t fully appreciated the quiet strength and love he gave me. That loss deepened my gratitude for the elderly who have shaped our lives and communities.
This gratitude inspired me to create Digital Literacy for Seniors, a nonprofit that bridges the generational gap by teaching seniors basic technology skills. It started when I noticed my grandma struggling to send texts or video call family members. As I taught her, I wondered how many others faced similar challenges. My nonprofit has since expanded to 15 chapters across five states, helping over 100 seniors in 8 retirement homes. By empowering them to connect with loved ones, navigate technology, and find joy in small things—like playing Candy Crush—we’ve made a lasting impact.
Through this work, I’ve honored the love my grandparents gave me by giving back to a community that is often overlooked. For me, “Gain and Give” is about learning from the support we receive and paying it forward with care, patience, and purpose.

The leaders of the club that I had the chance to meet were so inviting, kind, empathetic, and patient -- which are traits that are rare to come across while going through club recruitment; this really stood out to me as applicant as I know I work and learn better in an environment that I feel comfortable in. Alongside the inviting environment that team provided, this club also proves to be a very hardworking, professional and creative group which I learned through the website's client reviews.

","The core value of #Be, is the core value that I believe describes me best as humility, ambition, and tenacity are all three attributes that I try to embody consistently in my academic and professional career. A past experience that demonstrates this value would be the journey that I took in gaining admission into UC Berkeley after originally getting rejected. My senior year of high school, I knew that UC Berkeley was a school that I really wanted to attend as I knew the professional opportunities that this school offers, and overall thought that the school would be a great fit for me. When filling out my college applications, I failed to recognize and acknowledge a lack of academic performance in junior year due to a death in my life, and ultimately omitted this information from my original application as I was embarrassed of this poor performance. I had thought to myself, if I ignore it, hopefully they would too. Because I had failed to recognize this in my application, I was rejected from the school and was left heartbroken as this school was an institution that I had aspired to attend for a long time. In this instance, I had to embody humility, by taking a step back and setting aside my pride to acknowledge that I most likely did not gain admission due to my poor academic performance that I had chosen to ignore before. I showed ambition, by spending multiple hours over my spring break researching on how to effectively write an appeal, and how to best articulate my situation to admission counselors. I showed tenacity by not giving up on my aspiration of attending Cal, and by instead converting my frustrations into fuel for me to try to find another way to accomplish my goal.
